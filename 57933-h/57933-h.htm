<span style="font-size: x-small">⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯●⎯○⎯●⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯</span></h2>

<p>The object of this volume is to present in as consecutive
and comprehensive form as possible the history of the
Catholic Sisterhoods in the late Civil War. Many books
have been written on the work of other women in this war,
but, aside from fugitive newspaper paragraphs, nothing has
ever been published concerning the self-sacrificing labors
of these Sisterhoods. Whatever may have been the cause
of this neglect or indifference, it is evident that the time has
arrived to fill this important gap in the literature of the war.</p>

<p>“The Sisters,” to quote an army chaplain, “do not
have reunions or camp-fires to keep alive the memories of
the most bloody lustrum in our history, but their war stories
are as heroic, and far more edifying, than many the veterans
tell.”</p>

<p>That genuine humility so characteristic of the Sisters
has made the collection of the necessary data for this work
very difficult. Most of the stories embodied in the pages
that follow have been gathered by personal interviews,
through examinations of various archives and records, and
by an extensive correspondence with Government officials,
veterans of the war and the superiors of convents and communities.
It is impossible to enumerate all those who have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
aided in the work, but the writer desires to thank especially
the Sisters to whom he is indebted for the chapters relating
to the Sisters of Mercy who were with the Irish Brigade in
the West, and to the Sisters of St. Joseph who were at
Camp Curtin, in Harrisburg, Pa.</p>

<p>While the author has not hesitated to avail himself of
every possible source of information, it is only fair to say
that the great bulk of the material that goes to make up the
volume has been drawn from entirely original sources, and
is presented in printed form for the first time. In order to
form a basis for the work all of the obtainable literature
bearing upon the civil conflict was examined in a thorough
and exhaustive manner. It is no exaggeration to say that
nearly one thousand volumes bearing upon the “late unpleasantness”
were searched with the hope of finding some
data bearing upon the saintly work of the Sisterhoods. The
books of reference included the more important histories of
the war; the memoirs and recollections of the leading generals
of both the Union and Confederate armies; the debates
in Congress, the lives of the founders of the several
religious orders; the histories of the Church and of the
Sisterhoods, and a score of miscellaneous works too numerous
to name in a preface. The official records and correspondence
of the war, issued by authority of Congress, under
the supervision and at the expense of the government,
consists, in itself, of more than one hundred bulky volumes.</p>

<p>The return from this immense crop of literature, so far
as the Sisters were concerned, was ridiculously small. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
did not begin to be commensurate with the amount of time,
labor and patience involved in the research. A rare letter
or document, and the occasional mention of a Sister in the
reports to the War Department constituted the sum total.
The oft-quoted hunt for the needle in the haystack furnishes
the only adequate comparison of the work in this instance.
The Generals and the officials who had the direction of the
awful struggle were, in the main, too busily engaged in
making history to pause long enough to mention the modest
hands that bound up their wounds, soothed their fevered
brows and performed those other acts of faith and charity
that seem to belong essentially, not to the <i>weaker</i> but to
the gentler sex.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the files of the secular and religious
newspapers, from 1860 to 1865, were minutely examined
and the results carefully collated. Magazines and other
periodicals, including the illustrated weeklies of the time,
were also searched. The material thus evolved while more
promising than in the case of the histories and books of the
war was not entirely satisfactory. The paragraphs were
not only meagre and disconnected, but the dates and places
were uncertain and at times unreliable. But where these
newspaper stories could not be utilized, they were useful
in furnishing clues upon which complete stories were afterwards
built.</p>

<p>The general reader may not be deeply interested in
these details concerning the making of the book, but they
are given for the purpose of emphasizing the care and industry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
involved in the compilation and production of the work.
Through it all there has been a conscientious effort to avoid
political, sectional or religious controversy. In short, the
desire has been to present a modest picture of the grand
work done by the Sisters for <span class="smcap">Humanity</span>.</p>

<p>Of course, there has been no intention of presenting a
history, or even a sketch, of the war itself and the merest
thread of its events has been introduced solely for the purpose
of making the narrative of the Sisters as connected
as the scattered data permitted. The aim has been constantly
to present facts in an impartial manner. How far
the writer has succeeded remains for the reader to judge.</p>

<p>The chivalrous men wearing both the Blue and the
Gray, who caused American manhood and valor to be
known and respected the world over, have on many occasions,
and in various ways, given expression to the esteem
and affection in which they hold the women who devoted
their lives to the care of the sick and wounded. The ranks
of the war Sisters have been gradually thinned out by death
until but a handful of them remain. These survivors rest
in their convent homes, tranquilly awaiting the final
summons to a land where conflict is unknown. They may
die, but the story of their patriotic and humane work will
live as long as love for loyalty, regard for duty and admiration
for self-sacrifice exist in the hearts of the American
people.</p>

<span class="large">THE ORDERS THAT PARTICIPATED.</span></h2>

<p class="hang">One of the effects of the war. The productive force of the nation deprived
by death, disease and disability of one million men. The task of caring
for the sick and wounded. Four notable orders&mdash;The Sisters of Charity,
Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of St. Joseph and Sisters of the Holy Cross.
Their history and the discipline, experience and self-sacrifice brought to
bear upon their work during the war.</p>

<div id="i_019" class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>On the twelfth day of April, 1861, the first shot fired
upon Fort Sumter, formally inaugurated the civil war in
the United States. On the ninth of April, 1865, Grant
and Lee were the principals in the historic
meeting at Appomattox Court House, by
which hostilities were virtually terminated.
The interval between those two
memorable dates presents the greatest ordeal
in the history of the Republic.</p>

<p>As a result of these four momentous
years of conflict the nation was deprived
by death and disease of one million men.
The total number of enlisted soldiers in the
Union Army during the whole of the war
amounted to 2,688,523. As many of these men were mustered
in twice, and as a certain percentage deserted, it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
reasonable to estimate that 1,500,000 men were actively
engaged in the Northern armies.</p>

<p>Of this number 56,000 died on the field of battle, 35,000
expired in the hospitals from the effects of wounds received
in action, and 184,000 perished by disease. It is
probable that those who died of disease after their discharge
from the army would swell the total to 300,000. If
the effects of inferior hospital service and poor sanitary
arrangements are added to the other results of war, it
is safe to assume that the loss of the South was greater
than that of the North. But, considering the Southern
loss equal to that of the North, the aggregate is 600,000.
Add to this 400,000 men crippled or permanently disabled
by disease, and the total subtraction from the productive
force of the nation reaches the stupendous total
of 1,000,000 men. These figures seem almost incredible,
but they come from what, in this particular at
least, must be regarded as a trustworthy source<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>.</p>

<p>The task of caring for such an army of dead and
wounded was no light one. In the beginning of the war
this feature of military life was conducted in an uncertain
and spasmodic manner. As time wore on, it became evident
that the war was not to consist of a few skirmishes,
but was likely to be a protracted struggle between two
bodies of determined men<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>. Then the necessity of a systematic
sanitary and hospital service made itself apparent.
As a result of the pressing needs of the hour the Sanitary
Commission and the Christian Commission were organized.
The meritorious nature of the work of these great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
charities has been made known by reports and books
published since the war. The details of the good deeds of
both organizations in supplying nurses and in caring for
invalids generally are too well known to need repetition.</p>

<p>But the story of the labors of the Catholic Sisters is not
so well known. To begin with, the Sisters brought to their
aid in caring for the sick and wounded soldiers the experience,
training and discipline of the religious bodies with
which they were identified. Self-denial was a feature of
their daily life, and the fact that they had taken vows of
poverty, chastity and obedience peculiarly fitted them for a
duty that demanded personal sacrifices almost every hour
of the day and night.</p>

<p>From the data obtainable it appears that the members
of four Catholic Sisterhoods participated in the merciful
work incident to the war. These included the Sisters of
Charity, the Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of St. Joseph and
the Sisters of the Holy Cross<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>. The soldiers, like many
people in civil life, made no distinction between the orders,
and to them the dark-robed angels of the battlefields were
all “Sisters of Charity.”</p>

<p>There are now three orders of the Sisters of Charity in
the United States. The “black caps,” or Mother Seton Sisters,
who have establishments in New York, Cincinnati
and other places; the “white caps,” or Cornette Sisters,
of Emmittsburg, Md., and the Sisters of Charity, of Nazareth,
Ky. There are probably 5000 members of these three
orders of Sisters of Charity in this country to-day. The
Nazareth community was founded in 1812 by a few pious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
American ladies near Nazareth, Ky., under the good
Bishop David. Mother Catherine Spalding, a relative
of the late Archbishop of Baltimore, and of the present
Bishop of Peoria, Ill., was the first Superioress. The members
of all these three branches of the Sisters of Charity
did good work during the war.</p>

<p>The Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy was
founded by Miss Catherine McAuley, in Dublin, Ireland,
September 24, 1827. Seven Sisters, who came from Carlow,
Ireland, established the order in the United States,
locating in Pittsburg, Pa. The Sisters of the Holy Cross
have a Mother House at Notre Dame, Ind., and conduct
establishments in a large number of dioceses.</p>

<p>The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph was
founded in France, in 1650. In the general ruin incident
to the French Revolution, near the close of the last century,
the convents of the order were destroyed. The body
was subsequently reorganized, and six Sisters from the
Mother House at Lyon came to St. Louis in 1836, at the
request of Bishop Rosati, and founded a house at Carondelet,
Mo. This became the Mother House in this country.
A number of independent houses of the order have since
been established, notably the one at Chestnut Hill,
Philadelphia.</p>

<span class="large">ARCHBISHOP HUGHES AND THE SISTERS.</span></h2>

<p class="hang">The problem of how to provide the necessary nurses for both the Union and
Confederate Armies. Sisters not able to volunteer without the approval
of their superiors. An interesting epistle from Archbishop Hughes to
Archbishop Kenrick. The New York prelate appointed by President Lincoln
as a peace commissioner to France. A characteristic letter from the
martyred President to the great Archbishop. Quelling the draft riots in
New York city.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_023b.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LINCOLN.</p></div>

<p>Very early in the war the question of providing nurses
for the sick and wounded soldiers of both armies became a
serious problem, not only to the civil authorities, but also
to the Church officials. In every great
emergency questions of this kind generally
solve themselves. It proved so in
this instance. The first shot had hardly
been fired, the first battle fought and
the first improvised hospital put into
service, before volunteers from all sections
of the country had placed themselves
at the disposal of generals of the
contending armies. These offers came
both from lay women and from members
of the various Sisterhoods connected with the Catholic
Church in the United States. The Sisters, of course,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
being under certain rules and discipline, were not able to
volunteer until they had obtained the consent and approval
of their Superiors.</p>

<p>In the beginning the nurses for the armies were taken
from all walks of life. While they were zealous and entered
upon their work with the desire of alleviating suffering,
they did not have the disposition or training necessary
to carry on the work with the ease and thoroughness
essential to complete success. As the war progressed
and battles occurred more frequently, and the number of
sick and wounded became alarmingly large, the medical
directors in both the Union and Confederate armies began
to recognize and appreciate the real value of the Sisters.</p>

<p>The following letter<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>, written by Archbishop Hughes,
of New York, to Most Rev. Francis Patrick Kenrick,
D. D., Archbishop of the See of Baltimore, shows that the
subject was a live one in Church circles at that time:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="table w100">
<span class="tcell">To the Archbishop of Baltimore.</span>
<span class="tcell tdr">May 9, 1861.</span></p>

<p>Most Reverend and Dear Sir:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Superior of the Jesuits here called upon me
more than a week ago to state that their society would
be prepared to furnish for spiritual necessities of the
army, North and South, as many as ten chaplains, speaking
all the civilized languages of Europe or America.
I heard him, but did not make any reply. For myself
I have sent but one chaplain with the Sixty-ninth Regiment,
and to him I have already given the faculties
which you had the kindness to confer upon me for such
an occasion.</p>

<p>There is also another question growing up, and it is
about nurses for the sick and wounded. Our Sisters of
Mercy have volunteered after the example of their Sisters
toiling in the Crimean war. I have signified to them,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
not harshly, that they had better mind their own affairs
until their services are needed. I am now informed indirectly
that the Sisters of Charity in the diocese would
be willing to volunteer a force of from fifty to one
hundred nurses. To this last proposition I have very
strong objections. Besides, it would seem to me natural
and proper that the Sisters of Charity in Emmittsburg
should occupy the very honorable post of nursing the
sick and wounded. But, on the other hand, Maryland is
a divided community at this moment, whereas New York
is understood to be all on one side. In fact, as the question
now stands, Maryland is in America, for the moment,
as Belgium has been the battlefield of Europe.
As I mentioned several days ago, Baltimore must be destroyed
or it must succumb to Northern determination.</p>

<p>On these several points I would like much to know
what your Grace thinks and would advise.</p>

<p>Sincerely your devoted brother and servant in Christ.</p>

<p class="author">
JOHN, Archbishop of New York.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>While, as the Archbishop stated in his letter, Maryland
might have been a divided community, the same could not
be said of the Sisters of Charity of Emmittsburg. They
were united in occupying “the very honorable post of nursing
the sick and wounded” on both sides of the great conflict.
Soon after this the Archbishop changed some of
his views regarding the Sisters, as expressed in the
above letter. Both the Sisters of Charity and the Sisters
of Mercy in the Diocese of New York served in the
camps and the hospitals. To begin with, the Archbishop
withdrew his “strong objection” to the one hundred
Sisters of Charity who desired to volunteer in the early
stages of the war. After that all those who were willing
to undertake the humane work went into it with his blessing
and best wishes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>The following letter from President Lincoln to Archbishop
Hughes is of interest. It was the beginning of a
warm personal friendship between two strong men&mdash;a
friendship ended only by death.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
Washington, D. C., October 21, 1861.<br />
</p>

<p>Archbishop Hughes.</p>

<p>Rt. Rev. Sir:&mdash;I am sure you will pardon me if, in
my ignorance, I do not address you with technical correctness.</p>

<p>I find no law authorizing the appointment of chaplains
for our hospitals, and yet the services of chaplains
are more needed, perhaps, in hospitals than with the
healthy soldiers in the field. With this view I have
given a sort of quasi appointment (a copy of which I
enclose) to each of three Protestant ministers, who have
accepted and entered upon the duties.</p>

<p>If you perceive no objection I will thank you to give
me the name or names of one or more suitable persons of
the Catholic Church to whom I may with propriety tender
the same service.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your kind and judicious letters to
Governor Seward, and which he regularly allows me the
pleasure and profit of perusing.</p>

<p>With the highest respect. Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="author">
A. LINCOLN.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are conflicting opinions regarding the propriety
of the “war stand” taken by the Archbishop, but it is generally
agreed that he was one of the heroic figures of war
times. He had the absolute confidence of President Lincoln,
and on the 21st of October, 1861, was sent abroad
with Thurlow Weed on a “peace commission.” The Archbishop
went to France, while Mr. Weed confined his work
to England. At the same time Messrs. Mason and Slidell
were in Europe on a mission in the interests of the Confederacy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
The late Bishop McNierny, of Albany, then a
young priest in New York City, accompanied the Archbishop
to France, acting in the capacity of private secretary.</p>

<p>These two rival “missions” to Europe were covered
with all sorts of honeyed diplomatic terms, but their real
purpose was well known. Messrs. Mason and Slidell went
to induce one or more of the powerful nations of the old
world to throw the weight of their influence with the
Southern Confederacy. The mission of the Archbishop
and Mr. Weed was to prevent that result.</p>

<p>A letter written by Archbishop Hughes to Cardinal
Barnabo, at the time of his appointment by President Lincoln,
goes to show that the Archbishop accepted the mission
with the very highest motives. After explaining that
he had refused it once and only reconsidered his refusal at
the earnest request of the President, he adds: “My mission
was and is a mission of peace between France and England
on the one side, and the United States on the other.
The time was so brief between my visit to Washington
and my departure from New York that I had no opportunity
of writing to your Eminence upon the subject, or
of consulting any of the other Bishops in regard to it. I
made it known to the President that if I should come to
Europe it would not be as a partisan of the North more
than of the South; that I should represent the interests
of the South as well as of the North; in short, the interests
of all the United States just the same as if they had not
been distracted by the present civil war. The people of
the South know that I am not opposed to their interests.
They have even published that in their papers, and some
say that my coming to Europe is with a view to bringing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
about a reconciliation between the two sections of the
country. But in fact no one but myself, either North or
South, knows the entire object of my visit to Europe.”</p>

<p>Archbishop Hughes was one of the great men of his
day. He was on terms of friendship with several of the
Presidents who preceded Mr. Lincoln, and also enjoyed
the confidence and respect of the leading statesmen of the
nation. As early as 1847 he preached before Congress
upon the invitation of such men as John Quincy Adams,
John C. Calhoun and Thomas H. Benton. His subject was:
“Christianity, the Only Source of Moral, Social and Political
Regeneration.”</p>

<p>In July, 1863, Archbishop Hughes was instrumental
in quelling the draft riots in New York City. The mob
was beyond the control of the local authorities, and the
Archbishop finally consented to say a few words in the
interest of law and order. The venerable prelate was fast
approaching his end. He was so weak at this time that
he had to be conveyed to the balcony of his residence in an
arm chair. He spoke briefly, and succeeded in inducing
the rioters to return to their homes for the time being. It
was his last public appearance, and soon after this he
peacefully passed away, surrounded by friends and relatives
and the ever faithful Sisters of Charity.</p>

<p>In the chapters that follow it is proposed to deal with
the labors of the Sisters of Charity, taking up first the
Cornette or Emmittsburg Sisters, then the “Sisters of
Charity of Nazareth,” and finally the “black caps” or
Mother Seton Sisters. The concluding chapters deal with
the Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of St. Joseph and the Sisters
of the Holy Cross in the order named.

<p class="hang">Sisters of Charity inaugurate their labors in the Confederate Capital.
St. Anne’s Military Hospital begins with three hundred patients. A
zealous Sister makes her colleague prisoner in the pantry. An odor of
death, and how it was caused. The Union soldier who was “shot at

<p>In the early part of June, 1861, Dr. Gibson, who was
in charge of the Military Hospital at the Confederate
capital, Richmond, Va., called upon the Sisters of Charity
of Emmittsburg to come to the relief
of the sick and wounded soldiers in
that neighborhood. The late Rt.
Rev. John McGill, the Bishop of the
Diocese of Richmond, did not object
to having the Sisters engage in a
work of mercy, but he was opposed
to any hospital or infirmary which
might prove to be an obstacle to or
impair the prosperity of the church
hospital of St. Francis de Sales. The civil authorities did
not make any impression upon the prelate, but when the
Sisters themselves called at the episcopal palace and
begged to be assigned to the work, the Bishop could not
resist, and the coveted consent was obtained.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>It was announced that the Sisters would begin their
work on the following Saturday. Two physicians called
at the convent, and conducted them to the institution,
which afterwards became known as St. Anne’s Military
Hospital. The structure was in an unfinished state, and
the walls were not plastered. But it was thoroughly ventilated
and free from dampness, and that meant much in
a building designed for the care of the sick.</p>

<p>The house contained altogether about three hundred
patients. Each ward held from twelve to fourteen men,
and the rooms opened into one another. It was noon when
the Sisters arrived, and they were shocked to find that
many of the wounded men had not yet broken their fast.
The first care of the newcomers was to relieve the hunger
of the patients. To effect this they went to the kitchen,
making the acquaintance of “Nicholas,” the cook; “Black
George,” his assistant, and other occupants of this section
of the house. While these employes were good men and
were doing their very best, they succeeded but poorly in
having an orderly kitchen, or in providing the soldiers with
the sort of food adapted to their weakened condition.</p>

<p>One Sister among those who had volunteered to work
in the hospital was detained a little later than the others.
She felt remorseful at the unavoidable delay, but determined
to compensate for it by unusual activity. The first
thing that caught her alert eye on her arrival was a pantry
with the door wide open. Burning with zeal to be useful
she closed and locked the door. Suddenly there was a
rapping from the inside. The zealous Sister was not superstitious,
nor could she be called nervous, but these strong
noises frightened her, and she became pale as the rappings
continued to grow in volume and number.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>“Open the door and let me out,” came in sepulchral
tones from the pantry.</p>

<p>The key was applied and the door hastily opened, and
out walked another frightened Sister, who had been
imprisoned while searching for supplies.</p>

<p>After many little incidents of a trivial character order
was restored from chaos. Some of the soldiers declared
that the first meal they received from the Sisters was better
than anything they had eaten since entering the army.
The Sisters, that first night, got no sleep, for the wants of
the sufferers were pressing.</p>

<p>One of the patients called a Sister to his bedside and
in a low voice said: “You know the doctors think I may
not live over night, therefore I have a great favor to ask
that I hope you will not refuse. I have a mother.” Here
tears checked his utterance. The Sister said: “I understand;
you want me to write to her.” “Yes,” he said; “say
that her child is dead, but do not tell her how I have suffered;
that would break her heart.”</p>

<p>This delicate mission, like many similar ones entrusted
to the Sisters, was faithfully fulfilled.</p>

<p>The wounded men came from the battles and skirmishes
that had taken place in the vicinity of Richmond,
notably Phillippi, Big Bethel, Romney, Rich Mountain,
Carrick’s Ford and Manassas, Va. The last engagement,
which is also known as the first battle of Bull Run, ended
disastrously for the Union forces. It occurred on the 21st
of July, 1861, and the Sisters silently going the rounds
in their infirmary could almost hear the reverberating
sound of the shot and shell.</p>

<p>Toward night about fifty wounded soldiers, prisoners
from Manassas, were brought into the hospital, some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
dying and others wounded, and until better accommodations
could be provided they had to be laid on the floor.</p>

<p>One of the Sisters was called by the doctor, who said:
“Sister, get something for this poor man’s head; he has
just asked for a log of wood.”</p>

<p>The Sister went out, but where to get a pillow was
a mystery; everyone was engaged. At last a pillow case
was found, and the bright idea came to the Sister: “I will
stuff it with paper.” She brought it to the man, who was
a down-East Yankee, thinking the invention suited the
individual for whom it was destined. The poor fellow,
despite his suffering, smiled as it was given him.</p>

<p>It was very late when the Sisters finally prepared to
retire after a hard day’s work. They were not settled in
their room before Sister Blanche remarked:</p>

<p>“I cannot sleep; there is such an odor of death about
this apartment.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless they composed themselves as best as they
could. In the morning the secret of the strong odor was
revealed. A pair of human limbs amputated the week
before had been carelessly thrown in the adjoining room.
It was a great trial for the Sister to visit that room. She
covered her nose and mouth with her handkerchief and
threw open the windows. Under her directions the limbs
were at once interred. One of the Sisters writing in her
diary at his time says: “Yesterday a man was buried with
three legs.”</p>

<p>On Sunday morning an addition of eleven Union officers
was received to the number of wounded. They were
given accommodations in the garret. In the officers’ quarters
were found captains, majors, lieutenants and sergeants,
all wounded. One fellow blessed with a fine voice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
had a guitar loaned him, and he could always be seen in
a corner whiling away the dull hours. Sometimes these
invalid officers were annoyed by visitors who were untiring
in their questions.</p>

<p>“Where were you shot at?” asked one inquisitive
individual, meaning in what part of the body.</p>

<p>“Shot at Manassas,” was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>As one of the Sisters was crossing the porch a tall,
brawny soldier cried out: “You ladies have a sight of work
to do, but I tell you what, you get high pay.”</p>

<p>“None at all,” was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>“What!” said he, starting back with surprise; “you
don’t tell me you do all this work for nothing?”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” was the quiet response.</p>

<p>One of the nurses or hands about the place being
sadly put out about something that went wrong exclaimed
that he was “neither an angel nor a Sister of Charity,”
and that he would not put up with it at all. Sister Mary
Ann, in speaking of the varied dispositions of the men, said
that the Sisters “first got a puff and then a buff.”</p>

<p>Five of the Union officers who were in the garret
clubbed together after their departure and sent the Sisters
a check for fifty dollars for the benefit of the orphanage
in Richmond.</p>

<p>The Infirmary of St. Francis de Sales had been in
operation by the Sisters for the sick in general when the
war commenced, but after that it was utilized for the
wounded soldiers. On May 16, 1861, the Sisters in this
institution were appealed to by the medical authorities.
Very soon the building was too much crowded for the
patients. The Government then took a large house, which
was transformed into a hospital. It was thought that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
male nurses would answer the purpose. In a few days,
however, the surgeon and officers in charge went to the
Sisters at the Infirmary, begging them to come to their
assistance at the new hospital, as the sick were very
much in need of their services. The Sisters went to this
hospital on June 26, 1861.</p>

<p>Other hospitals in and around Richmond were built,
and as rapidly as they were made ready for use the surgeons
applied for Sisters to take charge of them. All of
the Sisters outside of the blockade which existed at that
time were at military posts, except those engaged in caring
for the orphans. The schools and academies controlled by
the Sisters had been closed for some time. As the Sisters
were sent to many different hospitals the number that
could be assigned for each one was small. The hospitals
were often without the necessaries of life. For the Sisters’
table rough corn bread and strong fat bacon were luxuries;
as for beverages, they could rarely tell what was
given to them for tea or coffee, for at one time it was sage
and at another herbs.</p>

<p>Soon after going to one of the new hospitals in Richmond
the surgeon in charge said to one of the Sisters: “I
am obliged to make known our difficulties to you that you
may enable me to surmount them, for you ladies accomplish
all you undertake. Until now we have been supplied
with the delicacies necessary for our patients from Louisiana,
but the blockade prevents this at present and I fear
to enter the wards, as the poor men are still asking for
former refreshments, and they cannot be quieted. We
dislike to inform them of the strait we are in, though
this state of affairs may be of short duration.”</p>

<p>The Sister hardly knew what to do, but proposed that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
wagons be sent among the farmhouses for the purpose
of gathering in fowl, milk, butter and fruit. This was
done, but in the meantime complaints had been made to
headquarters that since the Sisters had come to the hospital
all delicacies had been withheld from the poor sick.
The surgeon and Sisters knew nothing of this complaint
until a deputy Government official arrived to learn the
truth of the charges. He visited the wards during meal
time, after which he entered the room where the Sisters
dined. Then he told the surgeon the motive of his visit.
The surgeon was glad to explain to the deputy the cause
of the complaints. The deputy informed the soldiers that
the nurses were not in any way responsible for their sufferings,
and that the fare of the Sisters was always worse
than that furnished to the soldiers.</p>

<p>The men soon became convinced that they had been
too hasty in their judgment of the Sisters, and that the
stoppage of the delicacies was for unavoidable causes.
They found before long that the “Angels of the Battlefield,”
as they came to call the Sisters, had but one desire,
and that was to add to their comfort, as much as the
limited supplies would permit.

<p class="hang">The adventures of three Sisters who were detailed from the mother house at
Emmitsburg. Their offer to retire in the interest of the ladies of Winchester.
A night’s “repose” with foreheads resting upon umbrella
handles. A journey homeward by car and stage, and then across the
Potomac River in a flat canoe. A Sister received at the convent as one
from the grave.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i_036" src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GRANT.</p></div>

<p>Nearly all the Sisters that could be spared had been
sent from the mother house at Emmittsburg, and were
engaged in performing works of charity on the battlefields
and in the various camps and hospitals. On June 7,
1861, a telegram was received from
the authorities asking that a number
of Sisters be detailed to serve
the sick and wounded soldiers at
Harper’s Ferry.</p>

<p>In spite of the severe strain that
it entailed upon their available assignments,
the Superiors made the
sacrifice of sending three Sisters.
These brave women left Emmittsburg
on June 9 for Frederick City. Mother Ann Simeon
cautioned them to act with prudence, lest they meet with
trouble, as they had the Northern Army and its sentinels
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
to pass in order to reach their destination. An orderly
had been sent to escort them, but the Sisters passed their
intended guide without knowing it, he going by them on
the road to Emmittsburg.</p>

<p>An expected engagement kept villagers and farmers
quietly at home. Men cautiously whispered their fears or
opinions, and the sight of people bold enough to travel just
then was a matter that occasioned mild surprise. For
this reason the Sisters tried to huddle in the rear of the
stage coach, hoping to pass unobserved. During a brief
halt for the mail in one little town the driver opened the
stage door and handing in a letter said in a loud voice:</p>

<p>“Sisters, a gentleman in Emmittsburg desires you to
put this letter in a Southern post office after you have
crossed the line.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the curious and astonished people were
on them in a moment. The Sisters were not aware that
the driver knew of their destination, but they remained
quiet and made the best of the incident. The heat was
excessive. One of the horses gave out on the way, and
another had to be hastily substituted. After some delay
the party arrived in Frederick City. A few sentinels stood
here and there, but no one paid much attention to the
new arrivals. Before they started again, however, a
number of men gathered around their carriages, saying:
“Why, ladies, where are you going?” Several of the men
asked questions at the same time, but the Sisters stared
at them blankly, and civilly answered anything except
what the gossips most desired to know.</p>

<p>As hostilities had stopped the railway cars the pilgrims
had to continue their journey in the stage-coach.
Almost sick with heat they journeyed on until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
another horse succumbed. This meant more trouble
and suspense, but it was borne with heroic patience.</p>

<p>The most exciting adventure was yet to come. The
rocks of the Maryland Heights on one side, and the Potomac
River on the left, came in view. Just as the carriage
was, seemingly, proceeding smoothly on its way there came
a sudden grating sound and then an abrupt stop. “We’re
stuck!” ejaculated the driver, with more force than elegance.
The carriage was so tightly fastened that it was
feared the vehicle would have to be abandoned and the
remainder of the journey made upon foot. The driver
swore and stormed about, while the Sisters meekly looked
on in silence, fearing to further irritate him with suggestions.
Finally the carriage was extricated and the pilgrims
proceeded upon their way.</p>

<p>About twilight the Southern pickets were seen, for the
South still held a portion of Maryland. The first soldier
inquired where the Sisters were going, and with what
intent. He then passed them on to the next guard, and
so on until they came to the last, who said: “We have just
received such strict orders regarding persons crossing
in or out that it is not in my power to pass you on.” The
captain of the guards was sent for, however, and the Sisters
were transferred over the Potomac Bridge. Great
cargoes of powder had already been placed on this bridge,
so that, in the event of the enemy’s approach it might be
destroyed.</p>

<p>Harper’s Ferry is at the junction of the Potomac and
Shenandoah Rivers, the Potomac separating Maryland
and Virginia. A summit above the town, standing between
the two rivers, is called Bolivar Heights. On this
elevation was located the military hospital where the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Sisters were to labor. A neat little Catholic church was
located about midway between the valley and the town.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_039" src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BOMBARDMENT OF FORT SUMTER.</p></div>

<p>The hospital was filled with the sick, and around the
town lay thousands of men just arrived from the
most remote Southern States. A cold wet spell had preceded
the present heat, and many of the men were ill and
lay in their tents until vacancies opened for them in the
badly sheltered houses in the town. The men in one regiment
had contracted measles on their march; this
spreading among others with the exposure incidental to
army life thinned their numbers before the ball and the
sword had begun their quicker work.</p>

<p>On reaching their lodgings the Sisters found supper
prepared, and after disposing of this they soon retired
to rest. The stillness and darkness of the town was
frightful. No sound but the Sisters’ voices or footsteps
was to be heard. Not a light gleamed from the fastened
windows for fear of discovery by the hidden enemy. The
whole army had been sleeping or resting on their arms
since their arrival, expecting an early attack.</p>

<p>The medical director, who had sent for the Sisters,
came early in the morning and took them to the hospital.
With his assistant he escorted them from room to room, introducing
them and saying to the patients: “Now you will
have no cause to complain of not getting nourishment,
medicine and attention at the right time, for the Sisters
of Charity will see to all these things.”</p>

<p>The town had been by turns in the possession of the
North and South, and was therefore completely drained of
provisions and necessary conveniences for the sick. Notwithstanding
these difficulties things were beginning to
look more comfortable, when a telegram was received from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Winchester ordering the whole Confederate Army to repair
to that town immediately. The Northern Army, it
was announced, would attempt to cross the Potomac
above and below Harper’s Ferry, thus surrounding the
Southern Army and cutting off all supplies.</p>

<p>The soldiers moved at once, with the exception of
those who served the sick, and those who were to collect
the tents and finally destroy bridges and tracks. Provisions
were cast into the river by the wholesale, in order
to deprive the enemy of benefit. Then came new orders
to wait a while, but the invalids had already been removed
to the depot, to await the return of the cars from Winchester.
Arrangements were now being made for the destruction
of the bridges and tracks, and the Sisters were sent
to remain with a worthy Catholic family far away from
these structures. During the night one explosion after
another shook the grand bridge and seemed to shake the
mountains. The little Catholic church, the only one that
had not been applied to military purposes, was filled and
surrounded by the frightened people. The worn-out pastor
was their only consoler.</p>

<p>The Sisters looked at the awful destruction around
them, and felt encompassed with desolation. All the next
day they hourly expected to be called to the cars, but no
word came. They now learned that the ladies of Winchester
had written to the medical director requesting him
not to let the Sisters of Charity serve the sick, as they
themselves would wait on them. The Sisters knew that
the ladies had been enthusiastic in caring for the Confederate
sick and, thinking the delay was owing to the
embarrassment the doctors might experience in regard to
this, one Sister, acting as spokeswoman, said to them:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>“Gentlemen, we are aware of the ardor with which
the Winchester ladies have labored for your poor men,
and also know of their desire to serve the men alone&mdash;that
is, without any aid of ours; therefore be candid
enough to allow us to return to our home. If you feel
any difficulty respecting the ladies of Winchester tell us.
The Sisters consider it reasonable that they should wish
to serve their own people, and will not be offended, but
rather feel grateful for your friendly candor.”</p>

<p>The physicians replied that they did not care for
the objections that had been made to the Sisters; that
the ladies of Winchester could never do for the sick
what the Sisters of Charity would do, and therefore
unless the Sisters insisted on returning home the doctors
would hold them to their undertaking.</p>

<p>The physicians begged the Sisters not to leave
the town, but to await the signal for departure. Expecting
all day and even until 11 P. M. to be sent for, and feeling
that rest was absolutely necessary, the Sisters were preparing
for bed when the kind lady of the house came into
their room, saying: “My dear, poor Sisters, a wagon and
your baggage are at the door for you.” They soon left their
benevolent hostess, who wept to see them pursuing such
hardships. It was a genuine farm wagon, with two negroes
as drivers. The worthy pastor of Harper’s Ferry, who
was determined not to leave the Sisters entirely to strangers,
attended to their trunks and found seats for them.
The heavy spray from both rivers was thick in the air.
Here and there a star appeared between broken clouds,
giving barely light enough to see the sentinels at their
posts. One of these, advancing, asked the countersign,
which the pastor gave him. The wagon, running on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
high terrace edge of the Potomac River, made, with the
darkness, a gloomy prospect for the Sisters.</p>

<p>On reaching the depot an officer met them and offered
to find them a shelter until the cars would arrive.
He took them across two boards that formed a temporary
bridge. By the aid of his lantern they could see water
on either side of them, so that they had to watch carefully
and pick their steps lest they slip off the boards.
At last he opened the door of a little hut, which was almost
washed by the river. Here they entered and sat
down, resting their foreheads on their umbrellas until
between 3 and 4 o’clock, when a rumbling outside announced
the arrival of the cars. The train reached
Winchester five hours later. Almost the entire town was
occupied by soldiers, so that accommodations at hotels
were not to be had for any consideration. The zealous
priest, who was still with the Sisters, took them to the
church, and afterwards went in search of lodgings for
them.</p>

<p>The church, which was of stone, and was one of the
poorest old buildings in the place, was located in the
suburbs. A crowd of ignorant and curious men and
children followed the Sisters as they walked to the edifice.
As they entered the church the bystanders crowded in
and about the door. When the Sisters went by turns to the
confessional the village men and boys hurried outside and
peeped through the cracks at the penitents, peering into
their very faces. Soon the priest went out and as he did
so he shut and locked the door after him. After some
time he returned, although the Sisters feared that it was
just possible he had lost his mind and would not come
back. They knew his hardships had been excessive, because,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
besides being sick and without food or sleep, he
had many other inconveniences to contend with. But
he returned and took them to a plain, worthy Catholic
family.</p>

<p>The following morning being Sunday they walked to
the church, and just at the gate had to halt to let a company
of soldiers, on their way to Mass, enter the church.
About twenty or thirty Catholics constituted the congregation
usually, but on this day the soldiers and Sisters
made quite a crowded assembly. After that the Sisters
waited patiently for the doctors to take them to the scene
of their labors. The Reverend Dr. Costello had called on
them from time to time, informing the authorities that
the Sisters were ready to go to work among the sick. The
medical director finally asked them if they must remain
in one hospital, or whether each Sister could take charge
of a separate one. He was informed that their number
was too small to divide and they would remain at one
of the hospitals.</p>

<p>The heads of families in the city of Winchester
remained in town, while grown-up daughters and children
were sent to country seats, the mothers of these staying
at their houses, receiving and serving as many sick soldiers
as they could. The Sisters received much kindness
from these ladies, for they knew that the common rations
of the soldiers were very rough. Indeed, one of the greatest
distresses of the Sisters at this time was that they
had not more for the poor sick.</p>

<p>The Sisters began their labors in one of the largest
hospitals in Winchester. They worked incessantly day
and night, frequently not pausing long enough to take
necessary food and nourishment for themselves. Such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
labor began to show on them, especially as they were
only three in number. The doctors said that while more
nurses were needed there would be no way of sending
for more Sisters except by one of them going home and
returning with the others. Affairs had reached such a
crisis that only the Sisters of Charity could travel now.
One of them finally started off for the mother house, going
by car, then by stage, and then crossing the Potomac in a
flat canoe. Then she traveled by foot as fast as possible,
and after running for a mile reached the railroad
car before it left the station.</p>

<p>The evening of next day she reached St. Joseph’s, at
Emmitsburg, where she was received as if from the grave.
The anxious Superiors had heard nothing from or of the
Sisters except what meagre news was published of the
movements of the two armies. Sister Euphemia, afterwards
Mother Superior, left St. Joseph’s at once with
three companions for Winchester, to relieve the Sisters
there. At the same time a telegram was sent to Sister
Valentine at St. Louis instructing her to go immediately
and replace Sister Euphemia in Winchester, who was
to proceed farther southward, for in Richmond, Va., the
Sisters were almost overcome with continuous duty.
The Sisters, now six in number, continued their labors
in Winchester until very few remained in the hospitals.
The convalescent members of the army had been leaving
Winchester for some days, going towards Richmond.

<p>In the meantime operations in the great civil conflict
were beginning in the Southwest. The fact that Missouri
was a border State made it the scene of some of the most
dramatic events of the war. Thousands
of the sick and wounded of
both armies were cared for in St.
Louis. It was on the 12th of August,
1861, that Major-General Fremont,
commanding the Department
of the West, established a military
hospital in the suburbs of St. Louis.</p>

<p>General Fremont desired that every attention should
be paid to the wounded soldiers. He visited them frequently,
and perceiving that there was much neglect on
the part of the attendants, applied to the Sisters of St.
Philomena’s School for a sufficient number of them to
take charge of the hospital. He promised the Sisters, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
they would accept, to leave everything to their management.
There was no delay in acceding to this request.
Rev. James Francis Burlando, the Superior of the Sisters
of Charity, during a visit made to St. Philomena’s School
a few months previous had forseen the probability of such
an occurrence and given the Sisters directions to guide
them in such a case.</p>

<p>The Sisters had the superintendence of everything
relating to the sick in the hospital. Some of the soldier
attendants at first looked with wonder on the strange
dress and appearance of the new nurses, asking them if
they were Free Masons. The Sisters were, however,
treated with the greatest respect, so much so that not an
oath or disrespectful word was heard in the hospital
during the three years that they were there.</p>

<p>The hospital was visited every other day by the ladies
of the Union Aid Society, who could not help admiring
the almost profound silence observed in the wards. They
could not understand the influence the Sisters exercised
over the patients, both sick and convalescent, who were
as submissive as children. The Archbishop of St. Louis,
the late Most Rev. P. R. Kenrick, D. D., was pleased when
he learned that the Sisters had been asked for at the
hospital. The prelate provided a chaplain, who said Mass
every morning in the oratory arranged in their apartment.
After the Mass the chaplain visited every ward
instructing, baptizing and reconciling sinners to God.
There were hundreds of baptisms during the time the
Sisters were in the hospital, the greatest number of the
persons thus baptized dying in the hospital. The institution
was closed at the end of the war, and the Sisters
returned to their former homes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>Father Burke was one of the priests who did a great
deal of work in the hospital, and he bears testimony to
the fact that the patients thought there were no persons
like the Sisters. They would often say: “Indeed, it was
not the doctor that cured us; it was the Sisters.” When
returning to their regiment they would say: “Sisters, we
may never see you again, but be assured you will be very
gratefully remembered.” Others would say: “Sisters, I
wish we could do something for you, but you do not seem
to want anything; besides, it is not in the power of any
poor soldier to make you anything like recompense. All
that we can do for you is to fight for you, and that we will
do until our last breath.”</p>

<p>They preferred applying to the Sisters in cases where
they could do so than to the doctors, and as a result the
Sisters had a difficult task in encouraging them to have
confidence in the doctors. Every evening the Sisters were
accustomed to visit a tent a few yards distant from the
hospital, where the badly wounded cases were detained.
One night a Sister found a poor man whose hand had been
amputated from the wrist, suffering very much, the arm
being terribly inflamed. He complained that the doctor
had that morning ordered a hot poultice and that he had
not received it. The Sister called the nurse and wound-dresser
and inquired why the doctor’s orders had not been
attended to. They told her that there were no hops in the
hospital; that the steward had gone to town that morning
before they knew it, and they had no other opportunity
of sending to obtain any that day. The Sisters immediately
sent across the yard to a bakery and got some hops
and had the poultice put on. The poor man was gratified
and surprised. “The Sisters,” he said, “find ways and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
means to relieve everyone, but others who make a profession
of the work do not even know how to begin it.”</p>

<p>When a new doctor came to the hospital it was from
the patients that he would learn to appreciate the value
of the Sisters. When the patients returned to their regiments
they would say to their sick companions: “If you go
to St. Louis try to get to the House of Refuge Hospital;
the Sisters are there and they will soon make you well.”
Late one evening a Sister went to see that nothing was
wanting for the sick. She found a man suffering from
intense pain in his forehead and temples. He had taken
cold in camp and the inflammation went to his eyes, so
that he became entirely blind. The pain in his forehead
was so intense that he thought he could not live until
morning. The Sister asked him to let her bind up his
forehead with a wide bandage.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sister,” he said, “it is no use. The doctor has
been bathing my forehead with spirits of ether and other
liquids, and nothing will do me any good. I cannot live
until morning; my head is splitting open. But you may
do what you like.”</p>

<p>She took a wide bandage which, unknown to him, was
saturated in chloroform, bound up his head and left him.
Early in the morning she went to ask him how he spent
the night. He said: “Oh, Sister, I have rested well; from
the moment you put your hands on my forehead I experienced
no pain.” He never thought of attributing the relief
to the chloroform, because he did not know of it, and the
Sister, feeling that in this case ignorance was bliss, did
not enlighten him.</p>

<p>The patients had the best of feeling toward the Sisters,
and when the medical doctor visited the hospital he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
would stand in the middle of the ward and tell the patients
to whom they owed their comfort, the good order, cleanliness
and regularity that reigned there. He told them
that all these things came through the Sisters. It is a
notable fact that the respect with which they were treated
in the beginning never diminished, but went on increasing
while the hospital lasted.</p>

<p>Two of the prisoners of war, as the result of a court-martial,
were to be executed, but the worthy chaplain
who daily attended the prison obtained the pardon of one,
while the Sisters obtained that of the other. On one
occasion a soldier who was accused of desertion was sentenced
to be hanged, and the Sisters attended him until
all was over.</p>

<p>There was an elderly man confined in the prison hospital
who always found great pleasure in seeing to the
wants of his companions. He told the Sisters it made
him happy to see them get what they most desired. Toward
the close of the war he obtained his release, and
afterwards sent fifty dollars to the Sisters to supply the
wants of the suffering sick. His son soon after this was
charged with some military offense, tried by court-martial
sentenced and executed. The young man became a
Catholic, and in his last moments received the consolations
of the Church. His remains were given up to his
family, and his father requested the clergyman who attended
him before his execution to preach the funeral
sermon, which the priest did in a Baptist church, where
his hearers were all Baptists.</p>

<p>One of the priests who was untiring in his work
among the soldiers in St. Louis during those heart-breaking
days was Father Patrick John Ryan, now the Archbishop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
of the great Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Early
in the war he was appointed a chaplain by the Government,
but resigned his position, feeling that he could do
better work among the Southern prisoners of war if he
appeared among them simply as a priest. The rector of
one of the Protestant Episcopal churches in St. Louis succeeded
him as chaplain. Father Ryan is authority for the
statement that there were probably more baptisms in
this military hospital than on any of the battlefields or
in any other hospital of the Civil War.</p>

<p>He was a witness to many pathetic and humorous
incidents in the daily routine of hospital service. On one
occasion he was attending a poor drummer boy who was
only too surely approaching the end of his life of warfare.
He spoke to him gently of the things necessary to do under
such circumstances, instructed him to glance over his
past life and try and feel a genuine sorrow for all of his
sins and for anything he had done against his fellow-man.</p>

<p>The boy listened meekly for a while, but when he was
told to be sorry for all his wrong-doing a new light flashed
upon him. He half rose in bed and defiantly declared that
if this contemplated the severing of his allegiance to the
Southern Confederacy and an admission that the “Yankees”
were right he would have none of it. Half-amused
at the outburst, and not entirely unmoved at this flash
of spirit in what the lad no doubt deemed a righteous
cause, the good priest soon assured him that his mission
was not of the North or the South, but of God. The young
sufferer died soon after this with most edifying sentiments
upon his lips.</p>

<p>Sister Juliana, a sister of Bishop Chatard, of Vincennes,
who did good service in this and other hospitals,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
was the witness of many affecting death-bed scenes and
many wonderful death-bed conversions. Fervent aspirations
to heaven went up from the lips of men who had
never prayed before. Soldiers from the backwoods who
had known no religion and no God were in a few hours
almost transformed. It is estimated that priests and
Sisters baptized between five and six hundred persons at
this one hospital.</p>

<p>Archbishop Ryan tells the following incident that
came under his personal observation, and which John
Francis Maguire, Member of Parliament from Cork, has
incorporated in one of his works:<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>“A Sister was passing through the streets of Boston
with downcast eyes and noiseless steps when she was
suddenly addressed in a language that made her pale
cheeks flush. The insult came from a young man standing
on a street corner. The Sister uttered no word of protest,
but raising her eyes gave one swift, penetrating look at
the brutal offender.”</p>

<p>Time passed on; the war intervened. The scene
changed to a ward in a military hospital in Missouri. A
wounded soldier, once powerful but now as helpless as
an infant, was brought in and placed under the care of
the Sisters of Charity. It was soon evident that the
man’s hour had arrived; that he was not long for this
world. The Sister urged the man to die in the friendship
of God, to ask pardon for his sins, and to be sorry for whatever
evil he might have done.</p>

<p>“I have committed many sins in my life,” he said to
the Sister, “and I am sorry for them all and hope to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
forgiven; but there is one thing that weighs heavy on my
mind at this moment. I once insulted a Sister of Charity
in the streets of Boston. Her glance of reproach has
haunted me ever since. I knew nothing of the Sisters
then. But now I know how good and disinterested you
are and how mean I was. Oh! if that Sister were only
here, weak and dying as I am, I would go down upon my
knees and ask her pardon.”</p>

<p>The Sister turned to him with a look of tenderness
and compassion, saying: “If that is all you desire to set
your mind at ease, you can have it. I am the Sister you
insulted and I grant you pardon freely and from my
heart.”</p>

<p>“What! Are you the Sister I met in Boston? Oh, yes!
you are&mdash;I know you now. And how could you have attended
on me with greater care than on any of the other
patients?&mdash;me who insulted you so.”</p>

<p>“It is our Lord’s way,” replied the Sister gently. “I
did it for His sake, because He loved His enemies and
blessed those who persecuted Him. I knew you from the
moment you entered the hospital. I recognized you from
the scar over your forehead, and I have prayed for you
unceasingly.”</p>

<p>“Send for the priest!” exclaimed the dying soldier,
“the religion that teaches such charity must be from God.”</p>

<p>And he died in the Sister’s faith, holding in his
failing grasp the emblem of man’s redemption, and murmuring
prayers taught him by her whose glance of mild
rebuke had long filled him with remorse through every
scene of revelry or of peril.</p>

<p>Rev. John Bannon, S. J., was one of the priests who
performed efficient service as a chaplain during the war.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Father Bannon is now spending the autumn of his life
in performing the works of mercy and charity which go
to make up the life of a good priest, at St. Patrick’s Cathedral,
Dublin, Ireland.</p>

<p>Writing of his wartime experience in a letter dated
December 10, 1897, he says:</p>

<p>“Twice only did I come into relations with the Sisters’
hospitals. The first time was at Corinth, Miss., after my
arrival with the Missouri troops from Arkansas. There
I found the Sisters of Charity (bonnet blanc), from Mobile,
Ala., in possession of an hospital, located in a large brick
building situated on a hill overlooking a railroad crossing&mdash;for
the town of Corinth was little more at that time.
During the temporary illness of Father Coyle, who was
chaplain of the nuns, I visited the hospital for him a few
times. On one occasion a Sister indicated to me a cot
in a distant corner of the ward, whereon lay a large, burly
man, heavily bearded and of uncompromising aspect. He
had been questioning the Sister about her religion and
desired further explanations; so I was asked to go see him
and give him satisfaction.</p>

<p>“After a few questions about his home and family, and
wounds and personal comfort, I asked him about the
nursing and treatment of the hospital, a question which
brought him to ‘attention,’ for he sat upright in bed, looking
at me sternly, and almost fiercely said:</p>

<p>“‘See, now Mister, if you come here to spy after the
Sisters you’re in the wrong shop. There’s not a man
wouldn’t rise agin ye if you said a word agin them.
Don’t do it. Don’t do it, or I’ll&mdash;’ and he fell back exhausted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>“‘But, my friend,’ I said, ‘I’m a friend of theirs; I’m
a priest.’</p>

<p>“‘A priest,’ he repeated, and then, sitting up again, he
called out: ‘Sister, Sister, this man says he’s a priest;
is he?’</p>

<p>“To which the Sister answered, ‘Yes,’ and he fell back
saying, ‘All right, Mister, now I want to know if any
man ever believed such things as the Sister told me.’</p>

<p>“I assured him that I believed them all and had come
at the Sister’s request to explain them to him.</p>

<p>“‘All right, Mister, go ahead now.’</p>

<p>“So I proceeded to speak of God and the Trinity and
principal mysteries. He demurred to every word I said,
especially to the mystery of the Blessed Trinity, and to
each new installment of doctrine would sit up in bed and
call to the Sister (at the other end of the Ward), repeat to
her my statement, and ask her was that true, to which
when she answered ‘yes’ he would fall back on his pillow
and with a sigh of resignation say: ‘All right, Mister, go
ahead now, I believe it,’ and so on. He accepted my
teaching only on the word of the Sister, and on his faith
in the Sister I baptized him and left him happy. I had
not reached the door of the ward when he called me back.
‘Say, Mister, do ye reckon I’ll git better?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, I think so; at least I hope so.’</p>

<p>“His countenance fell visibly. But after a few seconds
he looked up and said:</p>

<p>“‘Whisper down nearer to me,’ and so pulling my head
quite close to his mouth, he whispered: ‘If I get well I’ll
have to leave the Sisters. I’d rather stay and die than
leave them. Good-bye. God bless ye. Pray for me,’ and
so we parted.</p>

<p class="caption">“PEACE FOR HER.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p></div>

<p>“Subsequently I heard Dr. Lynch, late Bishop of
Charleston, narrate a very like experience.</p>

<p>“The only other occasion that I remember visiting
a Sisters’ hospital was before the siege of Vicksburg, at
Jacksonville, Miss. The hospital was located in a large
hotel, downtown. As I entered the door I found the
hallway occupied for its length by two rows of sick
soldiers stretched on the floor, each wrapped in his old
worn blanket with his small bundle for a pillow. A tall,
gaunt, poor fellow had just come in and was spreading his
blanket, preparing to lie down. A Sister approached
and asked him for his ticket. He made no answer, but
having finished his preparations lay down and then proceeded
to search for the paper. When found, after a
long search, he handed it to the Sister, who, glancing
at it, said:</p>

<p>“‘My good man, this is not for us. It is for the
hospital in the Capital.’</p>

<p>“‘That mought be,’ he answered, ‘and I reckon it is.
But that don’t matter anyhow. This is my hospital, and
I’ll stay here, wherever the ticket’s for. Think I’m
gwine t’anywhar but the Sisters’?’</p>

<p>“And so he was tolerated and adopted by the Sisters,
for though inconvenient to the nuns it was consoling and
encouraging to them when they found their services so
appreciated by their patients.</p>

<p>From Jacksonville I went to Port Gibson, and then
to Vicksburg. There were not any Sisters at either place.
After the fall of Vicksburg I went to Mobile, where I
visited the Sisters’ hospital, but was not on duty there or
elsewhere up to my departure for Europe by the Steamer
R. E. Lee, via Wilmington, N. C., and Halifax.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>Many of the episodes of the war with which the Sisters
were associated would in their intensity and uniqueness
furnish the basis for stories and dramas more wonderful
than anything yet written by the novelists or
constructed by the playwrights. Here was frequently
illustrated the poet’s contention that truth is stranger
than fiction. One instance containing all of the elements
that go to make up a romance comes to mind. The two
principal figures in it were a sweet Sister of Charity,
burning with love for her fellow creatures, and willing
to lay down life itself in the cause of suffering humanity,
and a brave soldier, filled with patriotism for his country,
brought to the point of death by a malignant fever; nursed
back to life and finally, twenty-five years after the
war, giving an exhibition of gratitude as rare as it is
beautiful.</p>

<p>Thomas Trahey was born in Detroit, Mich., in 1844,
and was the only son of devoted parents. When the war
began he was about 17 years of age. Flushed with the
vigor and energy of youth he desired to enlist at once.
He did not succeed in carrying out his wish, however,
until August, 1862, when he enlisted in Company H,
Sixteenth Michigan Volunteer Infantry. When he was
mustered out at the close of the war it was as sergeant
of his command. He was commended many times by his
superiors for gallantry in action. In the battle of Fredericksburg,
December 13, 1862, he was struck by the fragment
of a shell and severely wounded in the left breast.
He was left on the battlefield all night, but finally received
attention at the hands of Dr. R. F. Weir, who was in
charge of the hospital at Frederick City.</p>

<p>Trahey recovered from this and went to the front
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
again with his regiment. After the battle of Gettysburg
he was taken with typhoid fever, which soon assumed
a malignant form. Dr. Gray, of Philadelphia, who was
in charge of Barracks H, in the United States General
Hospital, at Frederick City, made a careful diagnosis
of the case and said that Trahey, who was weakened
from the effects of his previous wounds and suffering,
could not possibly recover.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Sister Louise appeared
upon the scene. She inquired if careful nursing would
not save the man’s life. The physician said that it was
one chance in a thousand, but that if anything could
prolong the soldier’s existence it was the patient and persistent
care and watchfulness of a Sister of Charity.</p>

<p>“Then,” she exclaimed, “I will undertake the case.”</p>

<p>Sister Louise had been detailed from the Mother
House at Emmitsburg, and, though young in years, had
acquired considerable experience, which added to her
marvelous devotedness to duty and self-forgetfulness had
made her phenomenally successful in the hospitals and
camps. She was born of French-Canadian parents in
Toronto. She was a devout child, and early gave evidence
of a desire to embrace the religious state. Consequently
the whole of her early childhood was a preparation for
the life she was to enter. At an early age she came
to the United States and took the vows of Chastity,
Poverty and Obedience, and became a daughter of St.
Vincent.</p>

<p>At the time she was performing her labors at Frederick
City she was only 19 years of age, and was, moreover,
possessed of unusual beauty. Day and night she
remained at the bedside of her patient, frequently depriving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
herself of food and rest in order to minister to his
slightest wish. Finally he recovered, only to have a
relapse, which resulted in a severe case of smallpox.
This did not dismay the devoted nurse. She renewed
her energies. For three weeks after he became convalescent
the Sister fed him with a spoon.</p>

<p>Just as the patient was pronounced out of danger
the Sister was ordered away to another station, where
her pious attentions were given to other cases as serious
and as dangerous as the ordeal she had just gone through.
Sergeant Trahey returned to the front from his hospital
cot, and was wounded once again at White Oak Road,
Va., on March 29, 1865. He recovered and soon after, at
the termination of the war, returned to his home. For
several years he was unable by reason of his weakened
physical condition to perform any of the ordinary duties
of life.</p>

<p>After he had recovered he determined to seek the
whereabouts of the Sister in order to thank her for the
self-sacrificing care she had taken of him during the
most critical period of his life. As he expressed it at the
time, he was “willing to travel from Maine to California
merely to get a glimpse of her holy face.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Trahey first wrote to the Mother House of
the order, at Emmitsburg, Md., and received a reply that
Sister Louise had been ordered to St. Louis soon after
the war and had died there in 1867 of malignant typhoid
fever, the same disease that had so nearly ended the
life of the soldier. She expired at the Ninth and Madison
Streets Hospital, St. Louis, and was buried in Calvary
Cemetery, in that city. The grateful soldier had the grave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
cared for, and decorated it with religious regularity on
each recurring Memorial Day. Frequently he would visit
the grave in company with his wife and family, performing
a pious pilgrimage at once picturesque and edifying.
The desire to render the memory of Sister Louise
some service took a strong hold on him at this time. He
determined that the good Sister should have a better
tombstone than the modest little headpiece that occupied
a place over her grave. That there could possibly be
any objection to such an act of devotion and gratitude
never once occurred to the old soldier. He had the stone
cut at a nearby marble yard, but when the matter was
brought to the attention of the superintendent of the
cemetery the latter sent a communication to the church
authorities recommending that the request be refused,
as the grave was already provided with such a headstone
as marked the resting places of other members of the
order. At last the veteran called on Sister Magdalena,
the local Superior, and gave her a full account of the
case. He recited in detail the unusual service that had
been rendered him by the deceased Sister. The Superior
questioned him very closely regarding the character of
the stone that he desired to erect, and was particularly
anxious to know its exact dimensions. She was very
much impressed with his story, and expressed a desire
to accede to his wishes if it could be done without
ostentation or the appearance of any unnecessary show
in the Sisters’ section of the cemetery. She took his
request under advisement, and early in 1895 he was
given permission to erect the stone.</p>

<p>The simple monument of a Sister’s devotion to duty
and an old soldier’s gratitude is in the shape of a rustic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
cross beautifully engraved. On it is inscribed the following:</p>

<div class="poem bbox"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">To Sister Regenia La Croix,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Died March, 1867, in this city.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erected as a Tribute of Gratitude<br /></span>
<span class="i6">From an Old Soldier.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="author">T. T.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The grave is regularly decorated with choice plants
and flowers, and on Memorial Day especially it attracts
hundreds of visitors. The old soldier, with a show of
pardonable pride, says there is nothing like it that has
been erected over the grave of a Sister of Charity by any
old soldier during or since the war in this country.</p>

<p>The name upon the cross over the grave was the
name of the Sister in the world. She was known in
religion by the title of Sister Louise.</p>

<p>Speaking of the services rendered him by Sister
Louise Sergeant Trahey says:</p>

<p>“She was my only attendant, and no mother could
have been more tender or faithful. She brought me
dainties which I knew were almost priceless at the time,
and books that were as rare as gold, and in a thousand
ways did she add to my obligations. Naturally I became
greatly attached to her, and there is nothing in reason
that I could do to perpetuate her memory that I would
not do. Her beautiful face and kind attentions have ever
remained to me as one of the most precious memories
of my existence. I have not the slightest doubt but that
she saved my life. A glass of water given me from her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
hand seemed to infuse new life and strength into me.
Whenever she approached my humble cot she brought
sunshine and holiness with her. Every time I meet a
Sister of Charity upon the street I am reminded of my
ever-faithful nurse. I say, and I repeat with all reverence
and fervency, God bless her. I believe she is now praying
for me in heaven.”</p>

<p>This is one of the romances of the war, illustrating in
a high degree the heroism of self-sacrifice and the beauty
of gratitude. There are no doubt many other similar
incidents on record, differing somewhat in detail, but
all tending to show the love and reverence that invariably
followed the noble self-sacrifices of the Sisters.

white bonnets” for a Sister. The soldier whose life was saved by being
“shot in the U. S. A.”</p>

<p>When the fratricidal conflict between the sections
began very few persons paused to consider its
extent and consequence. But as each week passed it
grew in intensity and volume. In
the beginning of the year 1862 at
least 450,000 Union troops were in
the field, and half of that number
were under the command of General
McClellan in and around Washington.
Upon the breaking out of
hostilities old Virginia had at once become the principal
arena of the contending armies of the East. The Confederate
capital being at Richmond and the Union seat of
Government at Washington, D. C., only a short stretch of
country south of the Potomac River separated the armies.</p>

<p>A disastrous defeat at Bull Run on the 21st of July,
1861, caused the Union Army to retreat to Washington.
There were various minor engagements both before and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
after this date, but nothing of unusual consequence occurred
until February, 1862, when General U. S. Grant,
commanding the land forces, and Commodore Foote the
gunboats, captured Fort Henry on the Tennessee, and
Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River in Kentucky.
It was on this occasion, when the commander of Fort
Donelson asked for terms, that Grant gave the now historic
reply: “No terms except immediate and unconditional
surrender can be accepted. I propose to move
immediately upon your works.”</p>

<p>Some time before this the Confederate and Union
forces realized that they were insufficiently provided with
trained nurses. In the early part of 1862 the Government
made a formal request upon the Sisterhoods for nurses.
The Sisters of Charity were requested to send a deputation
to attend the sick and wounded in the temporary
hospitals at Washington. These hospitals consisted of
a number of rather dilapidated frame buildings and various
tents which had been improvised into structures for
hospital purposes.</p>

<p>The Sisters were promptly assigned from the mother
house at Emmittsburg, Md. When they arrived at the
National Capital they found the buildings and tents
crowded with patients. The majority of these had been
brought in from battlefields in the vicinity of Washington.
The Sisters endeavored to look after the temporal needs
of the men, in many instances acting in the dual capacity
of doctor and nurse. There were many incidents, some
of them of a humorous, most of them of a decidedly serious
character.</p>

<p>While the nurses were rushing from one cot to another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
a poor man who was in a dying state cried out at
the top of his voice, “I want a clergyman.”</p>

<p>One of the Sisters hastened to him and asked: “What
clergyman do you want?”</p>

<p>He replied: “A white bonnet clergyman; the one you
ladies have.”</p>

<p>“But you are not a Catholic?” said the Sister.</p>

<p>“I know that, but I want to see a Catholic priest.”</p>

<p>After a slight delay a clergyman reached his bedside.
The poor patient reached his skeleton-like hand to
the priest and began as follows: “In the Bible we read ‘as
the Father hath sent Me, I also send you, and whose sins
you shall forgive are forgiven.’ Now tell me has that order
ever been countermanded in any part of the Bible?”</p>

<p>The priest replied with a smile: “No, my son; it is the
same now as it ever was and ever shall be.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the sick man, “I have never disobeyed an
order when one who gave that order had authority to command.
Therefore being a good soldier I wish to fulfill that
order in every respect.”</p>

<p>As he was not in immediate danger and a man of
considerable intelligence the priest told him he would
come and see him again. The soldier asked for a catechism
or any book that would instruct him in the white
bonnet religion. Later he made a confession of his whole
life and was baptized on the following Sunday morning
in the chapel in the presence of the entire congregation.
He said he did not wish to be baptized behind closed
doors, but wished all to know that he was a Catholic.
While he remained in the hospital he would go from one
patient to another reading and explaining what had been
explained to him. Several of the soldiers argued with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
him upon the subject of religion, but with the Bible in
one hand and the little catechism in the other he would
put them all to silence.</p>

<p>One dreary night a score of ambulances drove up to
the hospital grounds with sixty-four wounded men. Of
this number fifty-six had been shot in such a manner as
to necessitate amputation of either a leg or an arm. Indeed,
a few of the unfortunates were deprived of both legs.</p>

<p>Some died in the short while it took to remove them
from the ambulance to the ward. The Sisters went from
bed to bed doing all they could to minimize the sufferings
of the soldiers. Two of the patients were very disrespectful
to one of the Sisters, showing anger and telling them
to begone. The nurse in charge quietly walked away.
After a little while another Sister went to them and
asked if they wished her to write to anyone for them.
They did, and she wrote as they dictated, then read it to
them and left. By this time they began to reflect on the
kindness that had been shown them and soon appreciated
the fact that the Sisters were indeed their friends.</p>

<p>Of the sixty-four wounded men eight died the next
day. There were thirty bodies in the dead house, although
it was the custom to bury two a day. For a while the patients
suffered from smallpox, which added very much to
the labors of the Sisters, since such patients had to be
separated and quarantined from the others. Several died
from the disease. One of the Sisters who waited upon
them took it, but recovered. Many of the patients who
seemed to dislike and fear the Sisters found they had
been mistaken in the opinions they had formed of them.
They often showed their confidence by wanting to place
their money in the custody of the Sisters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>One day a poor fellow obtained a pass and spent the
entire day in the city and returned at twilight looking
sad and fatigued. A Sister of his ward asked him if he
was suffering, and he replied: “No, Sister; but I am tired
and vexed. I received my pass early to-day and walked
through every street in Washington trying to buy one
of those white bonnets for you and did not find a single
one for sale.”</p>

<p>There are amusing stories of life in the hospitals, and
on the field, and the following one is vouched for by
Mather M. Alphonse Butler:</p>

<p>“Every Union soldier wore a belt with the initials
‘U. S. A.’&mdash;United States Army. When a wounded man
was brought to the hospital notice was given to the Sister
and she would at once prepare to dress the wound. One
day a man was brought in on a litter, pale and unconscious,
and the Sister rushed to give him attention. By degrees
he became conscious, and the Sister asked him where he
was wounded. He seemed bewildered at first, but gradually
his mind returned. Again the Sister asked him
where he was wounded. A smile spread over his face.</p>

<p>“It is all right, Sister,” he said; “don’t disturb yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she said, “they tell me you were shot.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “I was shot, but shot in the U.
S. A.”</p>

<p>The Sister understood at once the bullet had struck
the initials on his belt, and they had saved his life.</p>

<p>The Sisters were the witnesses of some very pathetic
incidents. The battlefield of Bull Run supplied its full
share of these. One of the brave Union men who was
killed in that disastrous engagement was Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Colonel Haggerty, of the Sixty-ninth New York Regiment.
It appears that Haggerty had interred the remains of a
child on the field and had enclosed it with an improvised
railing. At the head of the little mound was a narrow
bit of board, upon which was inscribed with small capitals
in ink the following:</p>

<p class="table">
<span class="tcell">Strangers<br />
please do not<br />
injure this<br />
inclosure.</span>
<span class="tcell tdc">
Here lies the remains of<br />
Harriet Osborn,<br />
aged 8 years.</span>
</p>

<p>Beneath this is written in pencil the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the storm clouds around us gather,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And this world seems dark and drear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us look beyond the darkness<br /></span>

<span class="i10">&mdash;Haggerty, Co. B, 69th Reg’t.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Haggerty must have been killed soon after performing
this touching act, for beneath the inscription is appended
this brief mortuary record:</p>

<p class="table tdc bbox">
Haggerty was killed at Bull Run<br />
July 21, 1861.</p>

<p>A correspondent of one of the Northern newspapers,
writing to his journal at the time said:</p>

<p>“This little memorial of one of the most conspicuous
men of the Union cause among the New York troops&mdash;over
whose fall one of his brother officers, Thomas Francis
Meagher, delivered at Jones’ Wood so heart-rending a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
eulogy&mdash;will be read with interest by hundreds of those
who remember him, proving, as it does, that the stern,
fierce, devoted soldier found time in the very moment
of danger to consider the fate of others.”</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Board of Officers of the Sixty-ninth
Regiment, held at their armory on April 3, 1862,
Captain Theodore Kelly, Lieutenant T. M. Canton and
Lieutenant Fahy were appointed a committee to proceed
to the battlefield of Bull Run and bring back to New
York the remains of their lamented brother officer, who
had fallen while gallantly leading a charge of the regiment
in the memorable conflict of July 21. The officers
indicated performed their mission and the body was
re-interred near the brave Haggerty’s home, in New York
City.</p>

<p>A letter received by the Sisters from Huntsville,
Ala., dated May 26, 1862, contains the following touching
passage:</p>

<p>“A few days ago a prisoner in the hands of General
Mitchell, named Cobb, a relative of Howell Cobb, died
in the hospital at this place. A Federal officer visited
the prison, as was his daily wont, and, learning the
facts, asked the other prisoners if they would not like
to attend the funeral. The reply was yes, but they
could not hope to have such a boon accorded to them
in view of their peculiar situation. The officer at once
repaired to the quarters of General Mitchell, stated the
case and received an order for their permission to
accompany the remains of their comrade to their last
resting place. He returned to the prison with the order,
exacted a promise that they should not seek to escape,
and put the party in charge of Father Tracey, the resident
Catholic pastor at Huntsville.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>“The procession wended its way to the cemetery,
when the young ladies of the town strewed the coffin
and the grave of the young soldier with the rarest flowers
of the garden, and evinced in the most unmistakable
manner their sympathy and their ardent love for the cause
of the South. The scene was at once solemn, grand
and affecting. There lay the earthly remains of the
devoted soldier in the narrow house of clay, and there
assembled hundreds of the fairest daughters of Huntsville
to shed the parting tear over the corpse of the hero
of their cause and garland the grave of the young
rebel with the choicest products of their sunny bowers.
There stood the minister of religion, chanting the office
of his church for the repose of the soul of the departed,
surrounded by the witching forms of angelic traitors
who made the air fragrant with the odor of their treason,
and comingling their anathemas of the Union with the
prayers of the priest. The sermon over, the prisoners
returned to their gloomy quarters, where they passed
a series of resolutions thanking the officer for his kindness
and General Mitchell for the courtesy he extended, and
closing with the hope that the day might not be far
distant when the defenders of the South and the defenders
of the Union could shake hands and fight by
each other’s side for a common cause.</p>

<p>“To-day the men and officers of the Fifteenth Kentucky
followed to the same spot the remains of Bernard
McGinnis, who died from a wound received at Winchester,
and over whose grave the same Father Tracey performed
similar services to those which he had done before for
young Cobb. How beautiful it seemed to the beholder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
to look upon the same minister amid the tumult of war,
contending passions and the fearful excerbations of the
public mind, lift up his voice to the throne of the
Most High and solicit the pledges of faith for the soul
of the young Georgian, and the faithful Irishman, without
a prejudice for one or a partiality for the other.”

<p class="hang">Terrible loss of life at the battle of Pittsburg Landing or Shiloh. Sister
Anthony wins enduring laurels. Seven hundred wounded soldiers

house. A Sister of Charity acts as assistant surgeon. Sisters refuse

<div class="figleft">

<p class="caption">SISTER ANTHONY.</p></div>

<p>The battle of Shiloh, Tenn, sometimes known as
the battle of Pittsburg Landing, was one of the great combats
of the war. Shiloh cost the Union army in killed,
wounded and prisoners 14,000
men, while the Confederates lost
10,700 men, including General Albert
Sidney Johnston, who fell in
the first day’s fight. The battles
were fought on the 6th and 7th of
April, 1862. The morning of the
6th was clear and beautiful, with
no indications of a storm; but the
day’s terrific battle was followed
by a night of drenching rain. The battle of the next day
was also succeeded by a fearful storm, which in this case
consisted of rain, hail and sleet. An eye-witness writing
of this says: “And to add to the horrors of the scene, the
elements of Heaven marshaled their forces&mdash;a fitting accompaniment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
to the tempest of human devastation and
passion that was raging. A cold, drizzling rain commenced
about nightfall and soon came harder and faster,
then turned to pitiless, blinding hail. This storm raged
with unrelenting violence for three hours. I passed long
wagon trains filled with wounded and dying soldiers without
even a blanket to shield them from the driving sleet
and hail which fell in stones as large as partridge eggs until
it lay on the ground two inches deep.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>It was by the work that she did at and after this battle
that Sister Anthony, a notable member of the Sisters
of Charity, won enduring laurels. She left Cincinnati for
Shiloh, accompanied by two other Sisters of Charity, Dr.
Blackman, of Cincinnati; Mrs. Hatch and daughter, Miss
McHugh, Mrs. O’Shaughnessy and some charitable ladies
of the Queen City. This trip was made on Captain Ross’
boat, under the care of Dr. Blackman. Sister Anthony,
whose mind is unimpaired and whose memory is excellent,
thus tells of her experience at Shiloh:</p>

<p>“At Shiloh we ministered to the men on board what
were popularly known as the floating hospitals. We were
often obliged to move farther up the river, being unable
to bear the terrific stench from the bodies of the dead on
the battlefield. This was bad enough, but what we endured
on the field of battle while gathering up the wounded
is simply beyond description. At one time there were
700 of the poor soldiers crowded in one boat. Many were
sent to our hospital in Cincinnati. Others were so far
restored to health as to return to the scene of war. Many
died good, holy deaths. Although everything seemed dark
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
and gloomy, some amusing incidents occurred. Some days
after the battle of Shiloh the young surgeons went off on
a kind of lark, and Dr. Blackman took me as assistant in
surgical operations, and I must acknowledge I was much
pleased to be able to assist in alleviating the sufferings of
these noble men.</p>

<p>“The soldiers were remarkably kind to one another.
They went around the battlefield giving what assistance
they could, placing the wounded in comfortable places,
administering cordials, etc., until such time as the nurses
could attend to the wounded and sick. I remember one
poor soldier whose nose had been shot off, who had almost
bled to death and would have been missed had we not
discovered him in a pen, where some kind comrade had
placed him before he left the field, every other place of
refuge being occupied. His removal from the pen caused
great pain, loss of blood, etc. The blood ran down his
shirt and coat sleeves, down his pantaloons and into his
very boots. He was very patient in the boat up the river.
On arriving in Cincinnati he was placed in a ward in our
hospital. Shortly after his arrival in the city a gentleman
came to Cincinnati and called at the Burnett House, which
was then used as a military hospital, inquiring for his son.
After searching everywhere else he called at St. John’s
Hospital. I met this sorrowing father just as I was leaving
the hospital to attend to some business. From the description
he gave I concluded that the boy without the
nose must be his son. I took him to the ward. When we
reached the bed where the man lay the father did not
know him.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said he, ‘if he is my child I shall know him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
by his head.’ Running his fingers through the boy’s hair
he exclaimed: ‘My son! my dear boy!’</p>

<p>“There was one young man under the care of Sister
De Sales. This Sister spoke to him of heaven, of God and
of his soul. Of God he knew nothing, of heaven he never
heard, and he was absolutely ignorant of a Supreme Being.
He became much interested in what the Sister said
and was anxious to know something more of this good
God of whom the Sister spoke. This good Sister of Charity
instructed him, and, no priest being near, she baptized
him and soon his soul took its flight to that God whom he
so late learned to know and love.</p>

<p>“Were I to enumerate all the good done, conversions
made, souls saved, columns would not suffice. Often have
I gazed at Sister De Sales, as she bent over the cots of
those poor boys, ministering to their every want, in the
stillness of the night. Ah! here is one to whom she gives
a cool drink, here another whose amputated and aching
limbs need attention, there an old man dying, into
whose ears she whispers the request to repeat those
beautiful words: ‘Lord, have mercy on my soul!’ I
asked myself: ‘Do angels marvel at this work?’</p>

<p>“Day often dawned on us only to renew the work of the
preceding day, without a moment’s rest. Often the decks
of the vessels resembled a slaughter house, filled as they
were with the dead and dying.”</p>

<p>The following is what an eye-witness says of Sister
Anthony: “Amid this sea of blood she performed the most
revolting duties for those poor soldiers. Let us follow her
as she gropes her way among the wounded, dead and dying.
She seemed to me like a ministering angel, and many
a young soldier owes his life to her care and charity. Let
us gaze at her again as she stands attentive kindness and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
assists Dr. Blackman while the surgeon is amputating
limbs and consigning them to a watery grave, or as she
picks her steps in the blood of these brave boys, administering
cordial or dressing wounds.”</p>

<p>A Sister relates a sad story of a young man who was
shot in the neck. The wound was very deep. From the
effect of this and the scorching rays of the sun he suffered
a burning thirst. He was too weak to move, when suddenly
the rain fell down in torrents. Holding out his weak
hands, he caught a few drops, which sustained life until
he was found among the dead and dying on the battlefield.
Cordials were given which relieved him. His looks
of gratitude were reward enough. Many other soldiers
who were thought to be dying eventually recovered.</p>

<p>After the Sisters had finished their work at Shiloh
they followed the army to Corinth, where the Confederates
had retreated. The river was blocked by obstacles in the
stream and progress by boat was necessarily slow.
Finally the impediments became so thick that the
boat was stopped altogether. The vessel was crowded
and the situation was a critical one.
The captain finally said that it was a matter of life and
death and that the Sisters would have to flee for their
lives. To do this it would have been necessary to abandon
their patients, who were enduring the greatest misery
on the boat. This the Sisters heroically refused to do. All
expressed their willingness to remain with the “wounded
boys” until the end and to share their fate, whatever it
might be. Such heroism melted the hearts of hardened
men. The Sisters fell on their knees and called on the
“Star of the Sea” to intercede for them, that the bark might
be guarded from all harm. And their prayer was answered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Two brave pilots came, who steered the boat to
their destination and to a place of safety.</p>

<p>After the war Dr. Blackman became an active member
of the medical staff of the Good Samaritan Hospital
in Cincinnati and ever proved a sincere friend of Sister
Anthony. The Sisters unite in praising the services of
Mrs. Hatch and her daughter. Miss Hatch was a most
estimable lady, who bestowed upon the soldiers the greatest
of charity and kindness. Many of them called her
“Sister Jennie,” a rare compliment for one who was not
a religious.</p>

<p>The groans of the soldiers on the battlefield of Shiloh
still linger in the memories of many of the Sisters. Sister
Anthony and her colleagues frequently picked their way
through the files of the dead and wounded, and on many
occasions assisted in carrying the sufferers to the boats.
These floating hospitals were unique in many ways, but
they will ever remain memorable as the scenes of the Sisters’
greatest triumphs, where they did so much for the
cause of humanity and where so many unwarranted prejudices
were removed from the minds of brave men.</p>

<p>Among the war Sisters none was regarded with
more affection and reverence than this same Sister Anthony,
who spent her last years near Cincinnati, surrounded
with all the loving attentions and comforts
that should go with honorable old age. Her work for
humanity was spread over a long series of years, and
the heroic labors she performed during the war form but
an episode in a busy and useful career. But it was a brilliant
episode, one that deserves to be handed down to
history and that brought fadeless laurels to a modest and
unpretending woman.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_077" src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SISTER ANTHONY.</p></div>

<p>Sister Anthony O’Connell was born in Limerick,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Ireland, of pious Catholic parents. She came with
them to this country at an early age, and, in pursuance of
a long-cherished idea, renounced the world and was vested
with the familiar habit of the Sisters of Charity. Her
novitiate and earlier years in the order were spent at Emmittsburg,
Md. Finally she was placed in charge of a
community at Cincinnati. According to good people in
that city who carefully watched her career, she displayed
unusual devotion, business talent and self-sacrifice.
Through her exertions an orphan asylum was founded at
Cumminsville, where large numbers of friendless and
homeless children were cared for and reared to a sense of
their responsibility to God and man.</p>

<p>When the Civil war broke out Governor David Tod
issued a call for volunteer nurses. Alive to the necessities
of the occasion, Sister Anthony relinquished the care of
her asylum to other hands and, taking a band of Sisters
with her, offered their services. Their work was in the
South, most of it being in and around Nashville, Shiloh,
Richmond, Ky.; New Creek and Cumberland. Colonel
John S. Billings, M. D., now of the Surgeon General’s office
at Washington, is one of the physicians having personal
knowledge of Sister Anthony, and he speaks of her
in the very highest terms. “I first knew Sister Anthony,”
he said to the writer, “in 1859, when she was in charge of
the old St. John’s Hospital, on Fourth street, Cincinnati,
in which I was resident physician, and I have known her
ever since. I can say very cordially that she was a competent
hospital manager and that I have always had the
greatest respect and affection for her.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>Sister Anthony and her brave assistants spent many
months in Nashville. The care and attention that was bestowed
upon the sick and wounded soldiers of both the
Union and Confederate armies did much to dispel the
thoughtless prejudices that had previously existed against
the Sisters. They went about like good angels, easing
many a troubled spirit and showering love upon all with
whom they came in contact. Sister Anthony stood out
in bold relief from all the others, and one who has knowledge
of those times says: “Happy was the soldier who,
wounded and bleeding, had her near him to whisper words
of consolation and courage. Her person was reverenced by
Blue and Gray, Protestant and Catholic alike, and the
love for her became so strong that the title of the ‘Florence
Nightingale’ of America was conferred upon her, and
soon her name became a household word in every section
of the North and South.” Many of the Sisters with whom
she worked fell upon the field of honor, but Sister Anthony
lived and survived to enjoy a peaceful old age and
the sweet thought and consolation of work well done.</p>

<p>The ending of the war, however, did not end her
work. After the white wings of peace had been spread
over the battlefields she returned to Cincinnati and made
an effort to found an asylum that should be larger and
greater than old St. John’s, where she had labored before
the war. For a time it looked as if this noble intention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
was to be frustrated. Funds were not available and
the usually charitable people of the city seemed to be indifferent.
They only seemed, however, for just when the
effort was about to be given up in despair, John C. Butler
and Lewis Worthington, two of the wealthy men of
the city, came forward with sufficient money to build and
equip a magnificent institution. The result of this was
the establishment of the Good Samaritan Hospital. Sister
Anthony was placed in charge and the work she did
there equaled, if it did not exceed, her war experiences.
Already a model nurse, she became a model hospital manager.
In the hospital she increased her great knowledge
and made a science of nursing the sick. She remained in
executive control of the institution until 1882, when devoted
friends finally prevailed upon her to relinquish her
task and live in peace and quiet the remainder of her life.
She has had several successors, the one now in charge being
Sister Sebastian.</p>

<p>Sister Anthony departed this life at 6 P. M. on Wednesday,
December 8, 1897, in her room, in St. Joseph’s
Maternity Hospital and Infant Asylum, conducted by the
Sisters of Charity at Norwood, O. Her last days were
as tranquil and peaceful as the most devoted friend
could desire. The fortnight before her death was spent
chiefly in prayer. On the Saturday prior to her demise
she received Holy Communion in the chapel attached
to the hospital. It was destined to be her last visit to
the holy table she loved so much. That same day she
was prostrated and compelled to take her bed. Here
she remained until she calmly expired on the following
Wednesday.</p>

<p>Sister Anthony made her home with the Sisters at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Norwood during the last few years of her life. Her love
for the poor unfortunates of the hospital and the helpless
little foundlings in the asylum was boundless. Notwithstanding
her extreme age she was very active and
delighted to mingle with the inmates every morning,
giving them words of comfort and consolation and in a
hundred and one little ways trying to lighten their
burdens. She was ever cheerful and kind, and those who
knew her best cannot recall an instance where a word
of impatience or complaint ever escaped her lips.</p>

<p>The news of her death created great sorrow among
the old soldiers, with whom she was a great favorite.
Many military organizations took formal action as an
evidence of their regard and esteem. For instance,
William H. Lytle Post, Grand Army of the Republic,
passed the following resolutions of respect:</p>

<p>“Whereas, The venerable Sister Anthony departed
this life on Wednesday afternoon, after a life of usefulness
in taking care of the sick and doing boundless
charity, and</p>

<p>“Whereas, She was one of the most active nurses
during the war, doing many kind, silent acts, and</p>

<p>“Whereas, She will be buried from St. Peter’s
Cathedral, Saturday, at 9 o’clock, be it</p>

<p>“Resolved, That, in order to show our gratitude and
affection for her and appreciation of her services as an
army nurse, we attend her funeral and invite all other
posts to participate with us.”</p>

<p>It is the usual custom for the Sisters of Charity to
be buried from the mother house, but in recognition of
the great services of Sister Anthony the Archbishop ordered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
that the funeral be from the Cathedral. The body
remained at the Foundling Asylum, where she died,
until Friday, when the remains were brought to Cincinnati
and laid in state at the Good Samaritan Hospital.
The following morning the last services were held in the
Cathedral. The scene was a memorable one. A vast
multitude gathered near the church; only a very small
proportion was able to gain admittance to the sacred
edifice. As the cortege approached heads were bowed
in grief and silent reverence. Not a wreath or flower
relieved the simple severity of the pall, but a dozen men
stood about the casket, its guard of honor. These were
the men who on the field of battle, in the rain of bullet
and shell, had watched the coming of that form, that now
lay cold within the narrow house, with anxiety born of
despair. The battle flags now furled and draped in their
hands had been the beacon that had led her where pain
and fever raged, and it was meet that the Stars and
Stripes should follow to her tomb.</p>

<p>In the casket’s wake came the guard of honor and
one hundred Sisters of Charity in their sombre habits.
The forward pews had been reserved for the Sisters and
orphans of the asylum, which the dead Sister had founded.
The white head-dresses of the little girls and white collars
of the boys were in marked contrast to the black garb
of the Sisters, silhouetted against the brilliant background.
Archbishop Elder, Bishop Byrne, of Nashville, a large
number of priests and fifty seminarians were present.</p>

<p>Archbishop Elder celebrated the mass, assisted by
the Rev. J. C. Albrinck. Rev. John H. Schoenelt was the
deacon of the mass, and Rev. Father Van Briss sub-deacon.
The deacons of honor were the Very Rev. John
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Murray and the Very Rev. John M. Mackay. Rev. Henry
Moeller was master of ceremonies.</p>

<p>Bishop Byrne, of Nashville, who preached the sermon,
said among other things: “We are come together to pay
the last tribute to one who is worthy of such a tribute&mdash;to
one whose figure was a familiar one on the streets of
Cincinnati, and whom you all knew and loved. Her
fame extended beyond the limits of the State and was
not circumscribed by the limits of a continent, and the
Church, always in sympathy with such nobility of character,
has draped her altars in black. Though she is
dead she lives. Every prophecy of the word conspires
to express this, that she has gone to live forever. That
prophecy bids us to exult for a soul gone to Christ. These
are the words of the epistles, these are the sentiments
expressed by the Church. * * * Christ was her inspiration,
and for this reason she trod the battlefield and
entered hospitals pregnant with pestilence. Her
presence was more to those brave sons of America than
that of an angel. Yet she was only a type of many.
For the same reason she loved the waifs and castaways, the
destitute, afflicted and lowly. I repeat that she was but
the type of many, and every Sister of Charity does these
acts. One thing more precious than all she has left us
and that is her glorious example. To her own Sisters, to
her own community, not to Catholics alone, her example
is precious. Her fidelity and devotion should be an inspiration.”</p>

<p>The words of the prelate impressed his listeners, as
was evidenced by their tears, and when his Grace, the
Archbishop, arose there was emotion in his voice as he
said:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>“You have heard it said what lessons may be drawn
from this sad occasion. The pleasures and pains of this
world pass away, and only the things done for God last
always. Only what is done for the world to come lays
by as an eternal treasure. We owe a debt of gratitude to
her whose life was so quiet and yet so glorious. We owe
her a debt of gratitude for the example she has set us for
our encouragement.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the blessing followed, and the mourners
filed from the church, preceded by the casket, which
after being placed in the hearse, began its last journey
to the mother house at Delhi, followed by eight carriages
containing the Sisters and the clergy. Arrived there the
soulless tenement was placed in the vault of the cemetery,
to find private burial without further ceremony at
the hands of the good Sisters, her friends and companions.</p>

<p>The following beautiful description of the funeral
and interment of Sister Anthony is from the Cincinnati
Tribune of December 12, 1897:</p>

<p>“Friday afternoon the remains of Sister Anthony
were brought to the Good Samaritan Hospital, where
they lay in state in the chapel, visited by hundreds of
sorrowing friends. A great number of girls employed
in factories near the hospital visited the chapel after
working hours to pay a last tribute of respect to her who
was at all times their friend and confidant in times of
trouble.</p>

<p>It was at the earnest request of the Sisters at the
hospital that the remains of Sister Anthony were brought
in. They wanted to have her with them once more
for the last time, amid the scenes of her noblest work,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
to pray beside her bier and bid a last farewell to the
spirit which they all emulate.</p>

<p>Visitors thronged the chapel far into the night and
there was little rest for the Sisters, who were up at
dawn and in the chapel again, where the Rev. Father
Finn, of the Society of Jesus, sang requiem mass, assisted
by the St. Xavier’s choir, under the direction of Mr. Boex.</p>

<p>When the time came for the departure to the Cathedral
a number of the friends joined in singing “Lead,
Kindly Light” and “Sweet Spirit Hear My Prayer” while
the body was borne from the chapel.</p>

<p>These two beautiful hymns were the favorites of Sister
Anthony, and she would have wished that they be
sung at her funeral.</p>

<p>In the Cathedral, the temple of the religion she loved
and worked and prayed for, two veterans of the Grand
Army of the Republic, bearing aloft the flags of their
country draped in sombre black, stood sentinel at her
bier.</p>

<p>There was the procession of priests and companies
of Sisters of Charity instead of the rank and file of
soldiery; there were embroidered robes and black habits
in place of the blue and gray; there were candles instead
of camp fires; there was the chime of bells and the
chanting of the choir instead of the call of trumpets and
beat of drums; there was the organ pealing instead of
the musketry roll; there was the fragrance of incense
instead of the smoke of the battlefield; there was the
counting of beads instead of the binding of wounds;
there was the bier and the sable pall instead of the hospital
stretcher; there were the whispered prayers of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
2000 people on bended knees for the repose of the soul
of Sister Anthony.</p>

<p>The morning light streamed dimly and softly through
the stained glass windows, and electric lights took the
place of the stars in heaven’s blue canopy, but it was the
bivouac of the dead.</p>

<p>The ministering angel to soldiers, the comfort of
widows and orphans, the friend of the poor, the sick
and the unfortunate was dead, and about her, come to
do her honor, were soldiers, orphans and widows; those
who had been poor and sick and unfortunate, her greatest
care in life.</p>

<p>The altars of the church were draped in black, and
with high requiem mass and eulogies the priests of the
church paid tribute to a noble member of their sisterhood.</p>

<p>Far up above the Ohio, on a beautiful plateau, with
a view for miles in every direction, is the mother house
of the Sisters of Charity, founded away back in the
thirties by pioneers of the order from Emmittsburg, Md.</p>

<p>Here is the grave of Sister Anthony. She lies beside
Mother Regina Mattingly and Mother Josephine Harvey,
who were with her when she first came West, and with
her helped to found the mother house. To-day they sleep
together in the little graveyard and near the home they
made for their sisterhood.</p>

<p>Their graves are in a little grove of birches and ever-greens
and surrounded by the graves of their Sisters
who have gone before.</p>

<p>Their graves are marked by simple stone crosses,
bearing their names in the world and in religion.</p>

<p>When the funeral train reached the house the Sisters,
headed by their chaplain, received the body and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
bore it to the chapel, where it lay in state for two hours.
The Sisters wanted their dear friend for that long at
least, for the mother house she always considered her
home, and they regarded her as a mother and loved her
as such, for to all she was ever the same sweet, lovely
and loving friend.</p>

<p>The services for the dead were read by the Rt.
Rev. Bishop Byrne, after which the body was borne to
the grave.</p>

<p>With slow and solemn tread the long file of black-robed
Sisters marched before. A drizzling rain had begun
to fall, and in the murky atmosphere the scene took
on a solemnity and grandeur impossible to picture. The
Sisters chanting prayers and the priests following in their
purple robes, and their heavy bass voices joining in had
a beautiful effect.</p>

<p>As the procession neared the burying ground the
‘Miserere’ was chanted by all.</p>

<p>There were very few at the graveside besides those
connected with the church. Thus ended the earthly
career of this “Angel of the Battlefield.”

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="large">PORTSMOUTH AND NORFOLK.</span></h2>

<p class="hang">The contest between the Monitor and the Merrimac, and general operations
of the war during the seven days’ battle near Richmond. The taking
of the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth by the Union forces. Sisters
narrowly escape drowning while crossing the river in a row boat. One
instance where hatred was turned to love.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i_087" src="images/i_087.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>In the East the Union cause had not been so successful.
When the Union forces at the beginning of the war
abandoned Norfolk, with its navy yard, they blew up all
the Government vessels to prevent
them from falling into the
hands of the Confederates. One
frigate, which had been sunk,
was raised by the Confederates
and transformed into an ironclad
ram, making her one of
the most formidable vessels
then afloat, though now she
would be considered ridiculous. This vessel, rechristened
the Merrimac, aided by three gun boats, destroyed the
United States frigate Cumberland, forced the surrender of
the Congress and scattered the remainder of the Union
fleet in Hampton Roads. That night, amid the consternation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
which prevailed, the new Union gun boat, called the
Monitor, designed by John Ericsson, arrived in Hampton
Roads and prepared to resist the Merrimac the next day.
The Monitor was a turreted ironclad. The following
morning, after a severe battle, the Monitor drove the
Merrimac back to Gosport Navy Yard, where she was
later blown up. This was one of the turning points of
the war.</p>

<p>In the meantime General McClellan made his advance
on Richmond, going by sea to Yorktown and advancing
thence on Richmond. For seven days there was tremendous
fighting near Richmond, the Confederates usually getting
the best of it. Finally McClellan retreated to Harrison’s
Landing to make a new effort. He was greatly disappointed
in not getting reinforcements, and finally was
ordered back with his army to Washington.</p>

<p>During the contest known as the “seven days’ battles”
the fighting commenced about 2 o’clock A. M., and
continued until 10 P. M. each day. The bombs were bursting
and reddening the heavens, while General McClellan’s
Reserve Corps ranged about three hundred yards from
the door of the Sisters’ house. While the battle lasted the
Sisters in the city hospitals were shaken by the cannonading
and the heavy rolling of the ambulances in the streets
as they brought in the wounded and dying men. The soldiers
informed the Sisters that they had received orders
from their general “to capture Sisters of Charity, if they
could,” as the hospitals were in great need of them.</p>

<p>One night the doctors called on the Sisters to see a
man whose limb must be amputated, but who would not
consent to take the lulling dose without having the Sisters
of Charity say he could do so. The Sisters said it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
dark and the crowd was too great to think of going. The
doctors left, but soon returned, declaring that the man’s
life depended on their coming. Two Sisters then, escorted
by the doctors, went to see the patient, who said to them:
“Sisters, they wish me to take a dose that will deprive me
of my senses, and I wish to make my confession first, and
a priest is not here.” They put his fears at rest, and he
went through the operation successfully. Sometimes the
poor men were brought to them from encampments where
rations were very scarce or from hospitals from which
the able-bodied men had retreated and left perhaps thousands
of wounded prisoners of war, who, in their distress,
had fed on mule flesh and rats. These poor men, on arriving
at the hospitals, looked more dead than alive.</p>

<p>Norfolk, being left undefended about this time, was
soon occupied by General Wool, who swooped down upon
it with a force from Fortress Monroe. The bombardment
of the cities of Portsmouth and Norfolk gave notice to the
Sisters of Charity that their services would soon be needed
in that locality. They had a hospital, an asylum and a
day school in Norfolk. The tolling of the bells on that May
morning first announced the destruction of the city. Soon
Portsmouth was in flames. Large magazines and powder
exploding shook the two cities in a terrible manner. The
hospital where the Sisters were in charge was crowded
with the sick and wounded. They were cared for as well
as possible with the limited means at hand. In a short
time, however, Norfolk was evacuated, and both that city
and Portsmouth taken by the Union troops. All of the
Southern soldiers that could leave before the coming of
the Northerners left, and the hospital was comparatively
empty. The Union soldiers crowded into the city and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
great confusion ensued. The Marine Hospital in Portsmouth
was prepared for the sick and wounded, and the
Union authorities asked the Sisters to wait upon their
men. These troops were in a deplorable condition. There
was no time to be lost and the Sisters lost none. They
were constantly administering by turns to soul and body.
Indeed, as far as possible, the self-sacrificing Sisters subtracted
from their own food and rest in order that the suffering
men might have more of both.</p>

<p>In a few days several more Sisters came to aid those
who were in charge. The newcomers met with many vexatious
trials on the way. First they were denied transportation,
and next barely escaped being lost in crossing
a river in a small rowboat, the frail craft, through the carelessness
of some one in charge, being heavily overloaded.
They eventually reached their destination, however, and
were enabled to effect much good among the men. Many
affecting scenes took place in the wards. The Sisters were
applying cold applications to the fevered men. One soldier,
bursting out in tears, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, if my poor mother could only see you taking care
of me she would take you to her heart.”</p>

<p>A man of about 23 years saw a Sister in the distance
and raised his voice and cried:</p>

<p>“Sister, come over to my bed for awhile.”</p>

<p>He was in a dying state, and the Sister knelt by his
bedside making suitable preparations for him in a low
voice. He repeated the prayers she recited in a very loud
tone. The Sister said:</p>

<p>“I will go away if you pray so loud.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Sister,” he said, “I want God to know that I am
in earnest.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>The Sister showed him her crucifix, saying: “Do you
know what this means?”</p>

<p>He took it and kissed it, reverently bowing his head.
While another man was receiving instructions he suddenly
cried out at the top of his voice: “Come over and hear
what Sister is telling me.” She looked up and saw a wall
of human beings surrounding her, attracted by the loud
prayers of the poor man. In this crowd and on his knees
was one of the doctors, who, being on his rounds among
the patients and seeing the Sister on her knees, involuntarily
knelt, and remained so until the Sister arose. The
patient soon after died a most edifying death, receiving
the last rites of the Church.</p>

<p>Another poor fellow seemed to have a deep-seated
prejudice against the Sisters. He constantly refused to
take his medicine, and would even go so far as to strike
at the Sisters when they offered it to him. After keeping
this up for some time and finding the Sisters undisturbed
and gentle as ever, he said, “What are you?”</p>

<p>The Sister replied: “I am a Sister of Charity.”</p>

<p>“Where is your husband?”</p>

<p>“I have none,” replied the Sister, “and I am glad I
have not.”</p>

<p>“Why are you glad?” he asked, getting very angry.</p>

<p>“Because,” she replied, “if I had I would have been
employed in his affairs, consequently could not be here
waiting on you.”</p>

<p>As if by magic he said in a subdued tone: “That will
do,” and turned his face from her. The Sister left him,
but presently returned and offered him his medicine,
which he took without a murmur. When he recovered
from his long illness he became one of the warmest
friends of the Sisters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>As the war continued the Government also made use
of the Sisters’ Hospital of St. Francis de Sales. Here all
things were under the direct charge of the Sisters, the
Government, in this particular instance, paying them a
stated sum for their services. During the time their house
was thus occupied about twenty-five hundred wounded
soldiers were admitted, of whom but one hundred died.</p>

<p>The Sisters had been at Portsmouth about six months
when the hospital was closed. Several of the Sisters were
sent to other points, while the remainder started for Emmittsburg.
The cars took them to Manassas, in the midst
of an extensive encampment, where they were told they
could not pass the Potomac, as the enemy was firing on
all who appeared.</p>

<p>The army chaplain celebrated Mass at this point, an
old trunk in a little hut serving as an altar. The Sisters
were obliged to go to Richmond, and it was two weeks
before a flag of truce could take them into Maryland. They
met the Judge Advocate of the army on the boat and he
showed them every attention, saying: “Your society has
done the country great service, and the authorities in
Washington hold your community in great esteem.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="large">LABORS IN FREDERICK CITY.</span></h2>

<p class="hang">The Sisters quartered in a stone barracks that had been occupied by General
Washington during the Revolutionary war. Patients see no necessity
for “tincture of iron” from the doctors. Soldiers without food for thirteen
days. Young scholastics from the Jesuit Novitiate in the capacity
of nurses. Not enemies “except upon the battlefield.”</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i_093" src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>On the 4th of June, 1862, a telegram was received at
the Central House, in Emmittsburg, asking that ten Sisters
be detailed for hospital service in Frederick City, Md.
The request came from the medical
authorities in charge of the hospital,
and it explained the immediate
and imperative need of the Sisters.
There were only three Sisters
at liberty in the main house
at the time, but the zeal of the
Superiors managed to secure seven
others from the various Catholic
schools and academies in the city of Baltimore.</p>

<p>The ten nurses started upon their journey without
any unnecessary delay and soon reached Frederick City.
When they arrived at the hospital they were received by
an orderly, who showed them to their room. It was in an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
old stone barracks, that had been occupied by General
George Washington during the Revolutionary War. The
room contained ten beds, so closely jammed together that
there was scarcely space to walk about them. An old rickety
table and two or three dilapidated chairs comprised
the only furniture of the room. The chief surgeon called
to welcome the Sisters and expressed the hope that they
would be comfortable in their military quarters. He informed
them that they were to call upon the steward for
whatever they needed. The medicine was plentiful, but
badly administered by the nurses, who did not attach
much importance to the time or manner of giving it.</p>

<p>The Sisters’ food consisted of the soldiers’ ration. It
was served to them on broken dishes, with old knives and
forks, red with rust. The patients often amused their
nurses by saying:</p>

<p>“There is no necessity for the doctors to order us the
tincture of iron three times a day; don’t you think we get
nearly enough of it off our table service?”</p>

<p>On the Fourth of July an addition to the sick from the
field of battle arrived at the hospital. The newcomers
numbered about four hundred, and the majority were
suffering from typhoid fever and dysentery. They came
unexpectedly and no preparations had been made to receive
them, so that many of the men had to lie in the open
yard of the hospital for nearly a whole day exposed to the
scorching heat of the sun. The Sisters were thus doomed to
witness a most distressing scene without having it in their
power to alleviate the suffering. Finally the Sister servant,
who could no longer behold such a spectacle, managed
to procure some wine, which, with the aid of water,
she multiplied prodigiously, thereby giving all a refreshing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
drink. This drew from the lips of the poor sufferers
many a blessing and prayer for the Sisters of Charity.</p>

<p>There were continual skirmishes in the Shenandoah
Valley, from whence large numbers of wounded were frequently
brought to the hospital, so that in a short time it
was overcrowded and the chief surgeon was obliged to
occupy two or three public buildings in the city as hospitals.
At the request of the doctors eight additional Sisters
were sent from the Mother House at
Emmittsburg, and they were divided among the various
hospitals that were occupied as temporary wards until
accommodations could be made at the general hospital to
receive the worst cases. The sick and slightly wounded
men were transferred to Baltimore.</p>

<p>A young man, a Philadelphian, was brought in one
day fearfully crushed, one hand and arm mangled to a
jelly. Opening his eyes he beheld a Sister of Charity
standing near him; a look of light succeeded the heavy
expression of weary pain and he exclaimed: “Oh, I wish
I were as good as the Sisters of Charity, then I would
be ready to die.” He begged for baptism. There was no
time to lose. The Sisters hastened to instruct him in
what was necessary for him to believe and then baptized
him, after which he calmly expired.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties with which the Sisters had to
contend was the improper manner in which the food was
prepared. One day the chief surgeon asked for a Sister
to superintend the kitchen, and one who was qualified for
the charge was sent for that purpose. Her silence and
gentleness soon quelled the turbulent spirits of the soldiers
employed in her office, so that in a short time they
became as docile as children. On the first day an improvement
was noticed in the hospital. The steward said that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
for the short time the Sisters had been there their presence
in the barracks had made a wonderful change. He
said that the men were more respectful and were seldom
heard to swear or use profane language. A Sister was
unexpectedly accosted one day by a convalescent patient,
whom, she often noticed, viewed her with a surly countenance
and would reluctantly take from her whatever she
offered him. He said:</p>

<p>“Sister, you must have noticed how ugly I have acted
towards you and how unwillingly I have taken anything
from you, but I could not help it, as my feelings were so
embittered against you that your presence always made
me worse. I have watched you closely at all times since
you came to the barracks, but when you came in at midnight
last night to see the patient who lay dangerously ill
I could not but notice your self-sacrificing devotion. It
was then that my feelings became changed towards you.
I reflected upon the motives which seemed to actuate the
Sisters of Charity and I could not help admiring them. I
thank you, Sister, for all the kindness you have shown me.
I am happy to say that the Sisters of Charity have left
impressions on my mind that will not be easily effaced.”</p>

<p>On the 19th of July, 1862, the feast of St. Vincent de
Paul, the Sisters received quite a treat in the shape of an
excellent dinner, sent by the director of the Jesuit Novitiate
and the Superioress of the Visitation Convent, in
Washington. Several ladies also visited them and sent
refreshments for the day.</p>

<p>There were many Germans in the barracks, and the
band of Sisters who were there only spoke the English
language. The Superior, however, sent a German Sister
who could speak to these men and interpret for the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Sisters. At their request one of the clergymen from the
Novitiate, who spoke the German language, heard the confessions
of the German Catholics.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_097" src="images/i_097.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FIRST BATTLE OF BULL RUN.</p></div>

<p>On the evening of September 5, 1862, the Sisters were
suddenly alarmed by an unusual beating of the drums.
They had all retired to bed except the Sister servant, who
called to them to rise quickly and go to the barracks; that
the Confederate army was in Maryland and would reach
the camp in the morning. They were informed that all
the patients who were able to walk, including the male attendants
and men employed about the hospital, would
have to leave the place in about an hour, and that all the
United States army stores in the city must be consigned
to the flames. Imagine their feelings at such news. The
hour passed like a flash. The soldiers all disappeared except
a few of the badly wounded, who could not be removed.
The signal was given and in a few moments the
entire city was enveloped in smoke and flames. The conflagration
was so great that it illuminated all the surrounding
towns. The Sisters spent the remaining part
of the night with the sick who were left alone in the
wards. The doctors who remained at their posts carried
their instruments and other articles to the Sister
servant for safe-keeping, knowing that whatever the Sisters
had in their possession was secure.</p>

<p>The next day dawned bright and beautiful, but what
a scene of desolation and ruin was presented to the view!
There was no one on the hospital grounds but the steward
and doctors, about four in number, and the Sisters, who
were going to and from the barracks attending the helpless
soldiers. It was then that these poor, helpless men
exclaimed in astonishment and gratitude:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Sisters, did you stay to care of us? We
thought you also would have gone, and then what would
have become of us?”</p>

<p>About 9 o’clock in the morning the Confederates were
discovered on the top of a hill advancing rapidly towards
the hospital. Suddenly the advance guards appeared in
front of the Sisters’ windows, which were under the doctor’s
office. One of the Confederates demanded without
delay the surrender of the place to the Confederate army,
in command of Generals Jackson and Lee. The officer of
the day replied, “I surrender.” The guards rode off and in
about fifteen minutes afterwards the whole Confederate
army entered the hospital grounds. It was then that the
Sisters witnessed a mass of human misery&mdash;young and old
men, with boys who seemed like mere children, emaciated
with hunger and covered with tattered rags that gave
them more the appearance of dead men than of living ones.
After these skeleton-like forms had been placed in their
respective barracks and tents the sick were brought in,
numbering over 400. The majority of these were, however,
half-dead from want of food and drink. They informed
the Sisters that they had been without anything to eat for
thirteen days, with the exception of some green corn,
which they were allowed to pluck on their march into
Maryland. The Sisters were delighted to find a field in
which to exercise their charity and zeal on behalf of the
suffering men. But, alas! a new trial awaited them. The
United States surgeon called upon the Sister servant and
told her that the Sisters could not at that time give any
assistance to the Confederates, as they, the Sisters, were
employed by the Union Government to take care of their
sick and wounded, but he added that the Union army was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
daily expected, and as soon as it would reach the city the
Confederate sick would receive the same care and attention
as the Union soldiers.</p>

<p>The citizens were now at liberty to do as they pleased.
They flocked in crowds to the hospital, distributing food
and clothing at their own discretion. This proved fatal
in many cases, as the diet furnished the sick men was contrary
to what their condition required. The young scholastics
of the Jesuit Novitiate near-by volunteered to nurse
the sick soldiers, and their services were accepted by the
United States surgeon, who arranged accommodations for
them at the barracks. The Sisters were also allowed to
give the scholastics meals in their refectory. It was truly
edifying to see the zeal of those school boys. Father
Sourin, the confessor of the Sisters, was likewise indefatigable
in his labors. He deeply regretted the restrictions
the Sisters were under, at the same time admiring the
wonderful ways of God in permitting the young scholastics
to gain admittance into the hospital, to fill the mission
of charity of which the Sisters were so unexpectedly
deprived.</p>

<p>On the fifth day of the invasion the Sister servant obtained
a passport from General Lee for two Sisters to Emmittsburg.
They were thus enabled to apprise the Superiors
of their situation. These same Sisters returned to
Frederick on September 12, accompanied by the Sister assistant
from Emmittsburg. On re-entering the city their
astonishment was great when they found that the whole
Southern army had disappeared. When they reached the
barracks the other Sisters informed them that the Confederates
had left the city the previous night, leaving only
their sick who were unable to be removed.</p>

<p>Frederick City was again in possession of the Union
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
forces and the good nurses were now at liberty to exercise
their duties in behalf of the sick Confederates who were
prisoners at the hospital. The doctors made no distinction
between them and the Union soldiers. They lay side by
side, so that the Sisters had it in their power to give them
equal attention. It was truly edifying to see the patience
and harmony that prevailed among them. They would
say: “Sisters, we are not enemies except on the battlefield.”</p>

<p>General McClellan was at this time in command of
the Union army. On one occasion he visited the barracks
and was delighted with the order that reigned throughout.
Before leaving he expressed a desire to have fifty additional
Sisters sent to nurse the sick and wounded, but the
scarcity of Sisters made it impossible to comply with his
request.</p>

<p>A reinforcement of Sisters was now required to go to
the various places occupied by the wounded. The Superiors
could only send a few on account of the great demand
for them throughout the different parts of the State.
In Frederick City the Sisters had to divide their services
between the barracks and the tents, and even then it was
impossible to do justice to all. They were thus occupied
for nearly six weeks without intermission except a few
hours, which they would occasionally take for repose, and
even that was frequently interrupted. They thought little
of fatigue or bodily privation, being happy in the belief
that they were not better served than the sick and
wounded.</p>

<p>During the month of September the Sisters were recalled
by their Superiors to the Central House at Emmittsburg,
and this for the time being ended their labors at
Frederick City.

<p class="hang">Sixty Sisters depart from Baltimore for the station in Virginia. Wounded
and dying men upon transport boats. Nurses who shared every horror
with their patients. Two Sisters who were martyrs to duty and humanity.

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i_101" src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The many appeals for Sisters to repair to the war-stricken
sections of the country, both North and South,
had widely separated the members of the Emmittsburg
community. The venerable Mother
Ann Simeon remained in executive
charge at home. Father
Burlando visited as well as he
could the various military hospitals
where the Sisters were stationed.
His care would not extend
beyond the line of hostilities, but,
fortunately, the Sister assistant
had been sent to superintend the missions in the South
before the blockade.</p>

<p>On July 14, 1862, the surgeon general at Washington
wrote for one hundred Sisters to be sent to a station
called White House, in Virginia, then in possession of
the Northern forces. So many were already in service
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
that it was impossible to comply fully with this request.
Sixty Sisters, however, started from Baltimore for that
place. As all traveling was attended with much difficulty,
the Sisters experienced many hardships. The authorities
intended to make a hospital encampment in the vicinity of
White House, as many thousands of wounded had been
brought there from the recent battles. No preparations
had been made for accommodating the Sisters, although
the officers and doctors were rejoiced at their coming.
General George B. McClellan, then chief in command,
was some miles distant at the time, but sent orders
that every possible care and attention should be offered
to the Sisters. Father Burlando accompanied the Sisters
to this place, and after receiving assurances that proper
arrangements had been made for them returned home.
They had only passed a few days here when suddenly all
hands were ordered to leave with the greatest haste&mdash;the
enemy was only two miles distant. Then began confusion
and additional suffering.</p>

<p>The wounded and dying men were hurriedly placed
upon transport boats. These vessels were so overcrowded
that they seemed more like sinking than sailing. The Sisters
were detailed to accompany the wounded to the several
cities where they were destined, the work of transportation
continuing for several weeks. The Sisters shared
with their patients every horror but their bodily pains.
They were in the under cabin, the ceiling of which was
low and the apartment lighted by hanging lamps and candles.
The men lay on beds on the floor, with scarcely
enough space to walk between them. The Sister in charge
of this lower ward was so persevering in her zealous attention
that even the doctor declared he did not know how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
human nature could endure such duties. A few months
later this Sister died from the effects of overwork&mdash;a martyr
to duty. The remaining Sisters not engaged with the
sick returned to Baltimore, but in a few days received a
summons to go to Point Lookout, situated at the southern
extremity of Maryland, bounded on one side by the Chesapeake
Bay and on the other by the Potomac River.</p>

<p>On the 14th of July, 1862, Father Burlando, with twenty-five
Sisters, left Baltimore, and in twenty-four hours
reached the hospital encampment of Point Lookout. The
Sisters were soon destined to have another martyr in their
band. They were only at Point Lookout two weeks when
one of the zealous band, who had contracted typhoid fever
on the transport boat, died from that disease. She
gave up her whole being as generously as she had offered
her zealous labors. Father Burlando had returned to Baltimore,
but a good priest, who came occasionally to the
encampment, heard her confession, and she received communion
a day or two previous to her death. The priest
being stationed twelve miles distant could not reach the
encampment in time to administer the last sacraments,
but arrived in time to perform the burial service. The kind
doctors and officers made every effort to suitably honor the
departed Sister. The men said they deemed it a great
privilege to act as the pall-bearers. All of the soldiers who
had died had been buried with only a sheet wrapped
around them, but for the Sister a white pine coffin was
procured. The authorities walked in procession, the drum
corps playing a dead march. There on the banks of the
Potomac rested the worn-out Sister of Charity. What a
subject for the pen of the poet or the brush of the painter!</p>

<p>Several cottages and tents, as well as wooden wards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
for the accommodation of thousands of sick and wounded,
made this narrow strait a thickly-inhabited place. Many
of the men were in a deplorable state from the effects of
their wounds and painful removals from distant battle-grounds.
The priest often came on Friday and remained
until Monday, constantly engaged among the soldiers, instructing,
baptizing and hearing confessions. On Sunday
mornings he said the first Mass at the encampment and
the second in the little chapel. The first Mass was said in
a tent surrounded by soldiers. The captain of the guards
marched his company to Mass on that day, and at the elevation
a drum was sounded and all adored profoundly.</p>

<p>Later on the officers gave the Sisters more cottages,
and by removing the patients they had a good-sized chapel.
With but few exceptions the doctors and officers were very
kind to the Sisters. Removals by death and the arrival of
more wounded men sometimes caused the wards to be
emptied and refilled again the same day. As soon as a
boat would land a horn was blown to let the Sisters know
that they must go to their wards. Then they would appoint
a place for each sufferer, giving the best accommodations
to those Who were enduring the greatest anguish.
Many among the new arrivals were Confederate prisoners.</p>

<p>About this time orders came from Washington that
no women nurses were to remain at the Point. After the
Sisters had begun their work a band of young ladies arrived
for the purpose of nursing the sick, and they were
surprised to find the Sisters there before them. When the
Sisters heard the order from Washington concerning “women
nurses,” they made preparations for leaving, but the
chief physician said to them:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>“Remain here, Sisters, until I hear from Washington,
for we cannot dispense with your services at this time.”</p>

<p>The physician telegraphed to the national capital and
received this reply:</p>

<p>“The Sisters of Charity are not included in our orders.
They may serve all alike at the Point, prisoners and others,
but all other ladies are to leave the place.”</p>

<p>About 5 o’clock on the morning of the 6th of August,
1864, the Sisters were at meditation in their chapel, when
they were startled by a noise like thunder, and, looking
out, saw the air darkened with whirling sand, lumber, bedsteads,
stovepipes and even the roofs of houses. A raging
tornado and waterspout were tearing and destroying
all in their way, taking in everything from the river to
the bay. The little chapel shook from roof to foundation.
Doors and windows were blown down. Sick and wounded
men were blown out on the ground. Wards and cottages
were carried several feet from their base. Two Sisters
who had not yet arisen, terrified at finding their lodgings
falling to pieces, ran out and in their efforts to reach the
chapel were struck down by the flying doors and as often
raised from the earth by the violent wind.</p>

<p>The Sisters were too stunned with surprise to know
what to do, though truly nothing could be done, for they
would only have left one part of the chapel for another
when the last part would be blown away. In one of these
intermissions a Sister seized hold of the tabernacle, fearing
that its next place would be in the bay, but the altar
was the only spot in the chapel that the angry elements
seemed to respect. Lumber and iron bedsteads were carried
over the tops of the cottages. The wards were nearly
all filled with patients, and several of these buildings were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
leveled to the ground. The men who were able to move
about were running in all directions for safety, many of
them only half dressed. One house was seen sailing
through the air, and the bodies in it at the time of the
storm were not discovered until some days afterward. The
storm lasted about ten or fifteen minutes, but in this time
heavy mattresses were carried through the air like so
many feathers. It was some time before all could be repaired.
The poor patients had to be cared for in some way
or other, and it was not an unusual sight to see the Sisters
standing by the stove with their saucepans of broth in
one hand and umbrellas in the other, only too happy thus
to relieve the poor sufferers.</p>

<p>The Sisters going to the Provost one day were informed
that a deserter was to be shot the next morning,
and they were requested to see him. They visited the
prison for the purpose of consoling the condemned
but the man showed no desire to see them, and they sorrowfully
returned home. Later the prisoner regretted not
having seen the Sisters, and asked to have them sent for.
The kind Provost sent an orderly, telling the Sisters of
the poor man’s desire. It was now very dark, and some
of the authorities advised the Sisters not to go until the
next morning. The orderly carried this message to his
superior but was sent back again with a note from the Provost,
saying:</p>

<p>“I will call for you on horseback and will be your pilot
with the ambulance. I will guide the driver safely through
the woods and will also conduct you home safely. I think
circumstances require your attendance on the prisoner.”</p>

<p>This was enough for the Sisters, and they were soon
at the prison, but found a minister of the prisoner’s persuasion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
with him. After he had finished his interview the
Sisters were taken to the man, who apologized for not
seeing them sooner. One of the Sisters asked him if he
had been baptized. He said, “No, never.” Then she informed
him of its necessity, and he regretted, with much
fervor, that he had not known this sooner. The Sisters
remained with him some hours, giving him such instructions
as his condition required. After baptizing him he
expressed his desire to see a priest. The Provost, looking
at his watch, replied that he could not be there in time.
It was now late and the execution must take place early
in the morning. The young man resigned himself fully
to his fate, saying:</p>

<p>“I deserve death, and freely pardon anyone who will
take part in it. I know I must die by the hand of one of
my company, but whoever it may be I forgive him.”</p>

<p>Then he returned to his devotions with such a lively
faith that the Sisters had no fear for his salvation. They
bade him adieu and promised to assemble before the altar
in his behalf when the hour of his trial drew near and to
remain in prayer until all would be over with him. The
kind Provost made all arrangements for the Sisters’ return
home, and said, when leaving the prison:</p>

<p>“May I have such help at my death and die with such
a good disposition.”</p>

<p>At the dreaded hour in the morning the Sisters knelt
before their humble altar, most fervently imploring the
Redeemer to receive the soul of the poor deserter. They
continued very long after the sound of the fatal fire had
told them that his destiny had been decided. The soldiers
remarked afterwards that every one on the Point was present
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
at the execution with the exception of the Sisters, who
had retired to pray for the doomed man.</p>

<p>Peace being declared, preparations were made for a
general removal. The doctors desired the Sisters to remain
until all the sick and wounded had gone. After this
they, too, left the Point on the 1st of August, 1865, going
to their home at Emmittsburg.</p>

<p>The Sisters carried away with them a sense of duty
well done. The sacrifices they made while at Point
Lookout were never fully made known, not even to their
superiors. Several Sisters fell victims to death and disease.
One of the most conspicuous of these was Sister
Consolata Conlan, who in the twentieth year of her age
yielded up her spotless life while in attendance upon
the sick and wounded soldiers.

<p>There was scarcely a time from the opening of the
war until its close that some of the Sisters of Charity were
not located at Richmond. This was a sort of unofficial
Southern headquarters for
them, whence they were sent
for duty on the various Southern
battlefields. The section of
country in which the Mother
House was located was in possession
of the Union army most
of the time. But the house
was looked upon as sacred property
by the generals of both
armies and was never molested by the soldiers.</p>

<p>Late in August, 1862, Dr. Williams, the medical director
of the army of the Potomac, made a hasty summons
for a detachment of Sisters to wait upon the sick and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
wounded at Manassas, where a severe battle had just taken
place. Five of the Sisters immediately left Richmond
for the scene of the conflict.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Manassas they found five hundred
patients, including the men of both armies, awaiting
them. The mortality was very great, as the wounded men
had been very much neglected. The wards of the temporary
hospital were in a most deplorable condition and
strongly resisted all efforts of the broom, to which they
had long been strangers. It was finally discovered that
the aid of a shovel was necessary. One small room was
set aside as a dormitory for the Sisters. They were also
provided with a chaplain and Mass was said every day in
one corner of the little room. Fresh difficulties and annoyances
presented themselves later in the season.
The kitchen, to which what was called the refectory
was attached, was a quarter of a mile
from the Sisters’ room, and often it was found more
prudent to be satisfied with two meals than to trudge
through the snow and sleet for the third. These meals at
the best were not very inviting, for the culinary department
was under the care of negroes who had a decided
aversion to cleanliness. On an average ten of the patients
died every day. Most of these poor unfortunates were attended
by either Father Smoulders, Father Tuling or the
Sisters.</p>

<p>After spending a long while at Manassas the Sisters
received orders from General Johnston to pack up quietly
and prepare to leave on six hours’ notice, as it had been
found necessary to retreat from that quarter. They had
scarcely left their posts when the whole camp was one
mass of flames and the bodies of those who died that day
were consumed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>The next field of labor for the Sisters was the military
hospital at Gordonsville. There were but three Sisters,
and they had two hundred patients under their charge.
The sick were very poorly provided for, although the mortality
was not as great as at Manassas. The Sisters had
a small room, which served for all purposes. One week
they lay on the floor without beds, their habits and a shawl
loaned by the doctor serving for covering. The trunk of a
tree was their table and the rusty tin cups and plates,
which were used in turn by doctors, Sisters and negroes,
were very far from exciting a relish for what they contained.
The approach of the Federal troops compelled the
Sisters to leave Gordonsville on Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>They retreated in good order toward Danville. Having
been obliged to stop at Richmond some time they
did not enter on this new field of labor until
much later in the year. At Danville they found four
hundred sick, all of whom were much better provided
for than at Manassas or Gordonsville. The Sisters
had a nice little house, which would have been a kind
of luxury had it not been the abode of innumerable rats,
of which they stood in no little dread. During the night
the Sisters’ stockings were carried off, and on awakening
in the morning the meek religious frequently found their
fingers and toes locked in the teeth of the bold visitors.</p>

<p>In November the medical director removed the hospital
to Lynchburg, as there was no means of heating the
one in Danville. The number of the Sisters had increased
to five, as the hospital was large and contained one thousand
patients, most of whom were in a pitiable condition.
When the Sisters arrived they found that most of the unfortunate
patients were half-starved, owing to the mismanagement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
of the institution. As a Sister passed through
the wards for the first time, accompanied by the doctor, a
man from the lower end cried out:</p>

<p>“Lady, lady, for God’s sake give me a piece of bread!”</p>

<p>The doctors soon placed everything under the control
of the Sisters, and with a little economy the patients were
provided for and order began to prevail. Father L. H.
Gache, S. J.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>, a zealous and brave priest, effected much
good among the patients. During the three years that the
Sisters remained in Lynchburg he baptized one hundred
persons. The approach of the Federal troops placed the
hospital in imminent danger, and it was decided to remove
the sick and the hospital stores to Richmond. The
surgeon general of the Confederate army begged that the
Sisters would take charge of the Stuart Hospital in that
city, which they did on the 13th of February, 1865.</p>

<p>Father Gache accompanied them and continued his
mission of zeal and charity. The Sisters were then ten in
number, and, as usual, found plenty to do to place the sick
in a comfortable situation. They had just accomplished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
this when the city was evacuated, and on the 13th of April
they left Richmond for the Mother House at Emmittsburg.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_113" src="images/i_113.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BATTLE OF ANTIETAM.</p></div>

<p>A terrible engagement took place near the Antietam
River, in Maryland, not far from the Potomac, on the 17th
of September, 1862. Not only were thousands on both
sides killed, but as many more were left wounded on the
battlefield, with the farmhouses and barns their only prospective
shelter. As the fighting had been from twelve to
fifteen miles in space, the towns of Boonsboro and Sharpsburg
were selected for hospital purposes. The general in
charge of the Maryland division requested the people to
aid the fallen prisoners, as the Government provided for
the Northern soldiers and would have cared for all if it
had enough for that purpose.</p>

<p>The Superior of the Sisters of Charity, with the people
of Emmittsburg, collected a quantity of clothing, provisions,
remedies, delicacies and money for these poor men.
The overseer of the community drove in a carriage to the place,
with Father Smith, C. M., and two of the Sisters.
Boonsboro is about thirty miles from Emmittsburg, and
the wagon containing the supplies reached the town by
twilight. Two officers of the Northern army saw the cornettes
by the aid of the lighted lamps, and, pointing to
the carriage, one said to the other:</p>

<p>“Ah, there come the Sisters of Charity; now the poor
men will be equally cared for.”</p>

<p>The Sisters were kindly received at the house of a
worthy physician, whose only daughter had previously
been their pupil. There were in the town four hospitals.
The morning after their arrival they set out for the battlefield,
having Miss Janette, their kind hostess, as a pilot.
They passed houses and barns occupied as hospitals, fences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
strewn with bloody clothing, and further on came to the
wounded of both armies. The poor men were only separated
from the ground by some straw for beds, with here
and there a blanket stretched above them by sticks driven
into the earth at their head and feet to protect them from
the burning sun. The Sisters distributed their little stores
among the men, although their wretched condition seemed
to destroy all relish for food or drinks.</p>

<p>Bullets could be gathered from the small spaces that
separated the men. They were consoled as much as possible,
but the Sisters scarcely knew where to begin or what
to do. If they stopped at one place, a messenger would
come to hastily call them elsewhere. In a wagon shed
lay a group of men, one of whom was mortally wounded.</p>

<p>An officer called the Sisters to him, telling them how
the mortally wounded man had become a hero as a flag-bearer
in the bloody struggle just ended. The poor fellow
seemed to gain new strength while the Sisters were near
him.</p>

<p>They were about to move away when the officer recalled
them, saying: “I fear the man is dying rapidly;
come to him. He has been so valiant that I wish to let
his wife know that the Sisters of Charity were with him
in his last moments.”</p>

<p>Father Smith was summoned and hastily prepared
the man for death. The thought of having the Sisters
near him seemed to fill the poor man with joy and gave
him the confidence and courage to die with a smile upon
his lips.</p>

<p>Two wounded Protestant ministers lay among the
wounded soldiers, and with one of these Father Smith
spoke for a long time while preparing the man for his end.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
The steward, who seemed delighted to see the Sisters, informed
them that he had met members of their order during
the Crimean War.</p>

<p>A Northern steward and a Southern surgeon became
involved in a personal dispute, which ended by one challenging
the other to meet him in mortal combat in a retired
spot near the battlefield. Both withdrew towards
an old shed, at the same time talking in a loud voice,
threatening each other in angry tones. No one interfered
and the duel would have taken place had not one of the
Sisters followed them. She spoke to both of them firmly
and reproachfully, taking their pistols from them, and the
affair ended by their separating like docile children, each
retiring to his post.</p>

<p>Nightfall drove the Sisters to their lodgings in the
town, but they returned early in the morning. The medical
director met the Sisters, saying: “You dine with
me to-day,” and added: “If you will remain I shall make arrangements
for your accommodations.” But he was ordered
elsewhere a few hours later and the Sisters saw no
more of him.</p>

<p>The Sisters were requested by one of the officers to attend
the funeral of the brave flag-bearer. It was about
dusk and eight or ten persons followed the body to the
grave, besides Rev. Father Smith and the Sisters. Presently
they saw about two hundred soldiers on horseback galloping
towards them. A few of the horsemen approached
the group of mourners and taking off their caps and bowing
one of them said:</p>

<p>“I am General McClellan and I am happy and proud
to see the Sisters of Charity with these poor men. How
many are here?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>“Two,” was the reply. “We came here to bring relief
to the suffering, and we return in a day or so.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he replied, “why can we not have more here? I
would like to see fifty Sisters ministering to the poor sufferers.
Whom shall I address for this purpose?”</p>

<p>Father Smith gave him the address of the Superior
Emmitsburg. Then he asked:</p>

<p>“Do you know how the brave standard-bearer is doing?”</p>

<p>He was informed that the flag-bearer was just about
to be buried, whereupon he joined the procession and remained
until after the interment.</p>

<p>General McClellan at this time was in the full
flush of a vigorous manhood, with the added prestige of a
West Point education. His command was considered
the finest body of men in either the Union or the Confederate
army. Just prior to the battle of Antietam General
McClellan had ordered a review of his troops before
the President and the members of his Cabinet. It was
a magnificent sight to see 70,000 well-drilled and well-dressed
soldiers keeping step to the tune of martial music.
What a difference between then and now. The finest
blood in the nation lay spilled upon the field of Antietam;
the dread hand of death had broken up and demoralized
the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>General McClellan was the idol of his men and was
affectionately styled “Little Mac.” Upon his staff were
two volunteers from France, the Compte de Paris and
the Duc de Chartres. They were grandsons of King Louis
Philippe, were commissioned in the Union army and
served without pay as aides-de-camp to General McClellan.
The Compte de Paris has written what is considered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
to be the best and most impartial history of the civil war
extant. Both of these distinguished volunteers were with
General McClellan at the time of his conversation with the
Sisters.</p>

<p>About this time the work of removing the wounded
soldiers to Frederick City and Hagerstown began. During
the time the Sisters remained on the battlefield they
went from farm to farm trying to find those who were in
most danger. The Sisters were in constant danger from
bomb shells which had not exploded and which only required
a slight jar to burst. The ground was covered with
these and it was hard to distinguish them while the carriage
wheels were rolling over straw and dry leaves. The
farms in the vicinity were laid waste. Unthreshed wheat
was used for roofing of tents or pillows for the men. A
few fences that had been spared by the cannon balls were
used for fuel. The quiet farmhouses contained none of
their former inhabitants. Stock in the shape of cattle
and fowl seemed to have disappeared from the face of the
earth. Even the dogs were either killed or had fled from
the appalling scene. It was very remarkable also that on
none of the battlefields during the war were there any
carrion birds, not even a crow, though piles of dead horses
lay here and there. Some of these animals were half burned
from the efforts made to consume them by lighting fence
rails over them, but this seemed rather to add to the foulness
of the atmosphere than help to purify it. Long ridges
of earth with sticks here and there told “so many of the
Northern army lie here” or “so many of the Southern army
lie there.” General McClellan’s army was encamped in the
neighborhood, with arms stacked, shining in the sun like
spears of silver.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>A Northern soldier was rebuking a sympathizing lady
for her partiality towards the fallen Southerners and said:
“How I admire the Sisters of Charity in this matter. When
I was in Portsmouth, Va., they were called over from Norfolk
to serve their own men, the Southerners, in their hospitals
and labored in untiring charity. When, a few weeks
later, our men took the place and the same hospital was
filled with the Northern soldiers, these good Sisters were
called on again, when they resumed their kind attention
the same as if there was no sectional change in the men.”
“This,” he continued, “was true Christian charity, and I
would not fear for any human misery when the Sisters
have control. This, young lady, is what all you young ladies
ought to do.”</p>

<p>The following day Father Smith celebrated two Masses
in the parlor of the house at which he was stopping. The
Sisters left this place on the 8th of October, having spent
six days among the wounded soldiers, who had nearly all
been removed at this time from the neighborhood.

<p>On the 25th of April, 1862, a fleet under the famous
Admiral Farragut, together with a land force under General
Benjamin F. Butler, captured the city of New Orleans.
Butler assumed charge of the
“commercial metropolis of the
Southwest,” as it was then called,
while the gun boats proceeded up
the Mississippi River, subjugating
other cities and towns along its
banks. One of these was Donaldsonville.
In shelling this place Admiral Farragut injured
some of the property under the charge of the Sisters of
Charity. The Superior entered a complaint with General
Butler and in return received the following chivalrous letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, La.,
September 2, 1862.</p>

<p>“Santa Maria Clara, Superior and Sister of Charity.</p>

<p>“Madame: I had no information until the reception of
your note that so sad a result to the Sisters of your community
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
had happened from the bombardment of Donaldsonville.</p>

<p>“I am very, very sorry that Rear Admiral Farragut
was unaware that he was injuring your establishment by
his shells. Any injury must have been entirely accidental.
The destruction of that town became a necessity. The inhabitants
harbored a gang of cowardly guerrillas, who
committed every atrocity, amongst others that of firing
upon an unarmed boat crowded with women and children
going up the coast, returning to their homes, many of them
having been at school in New Orleans.</p>

<p>“It is impossible to allow such acts, and I am only sorry
that the righteous punishment meted out to them in
this instance, as, indeed, in all others, fell quite as heavily
upon the innocent and unoffending as upon the guilty.</p>

<p>“No one can appreciate more fully than myself the
holy, self-sacrificing labors of the Sisters of Charity. To
them old soldiers are daily indebted for the kindest offices.
Sisters to all mankind, they know no nation, no kindred,
neither war nor peace. Their all-pervading charity is like
the boundless love of ‘Him who died for all,’ whose servants
they are and whose pure teachings their love illustrates.</p>

<p>“I repeat my grief that any harm should have befallen
your society of Sisters and will cheerfully repair it, so
far as I may, in the manner you suggest by filling the
order you have sent to the city for provisions and medicines.</p>

<p>“Your Sisters in the city will also further testify to
you that my officers and soldiers have never failed to do to
them all in our power to aid them in their usefulness and
to lighten the burden of their labors.</p>

<p>“With sentiments of the highest respect, believe me
your friend,</p>

<p class="author">
Benj. F. Butler.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Some time after this General Blanchard, who was in
command of the military in Monroe, La., made a request
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
for Sisters to care for the sick and wounded under his
charge. A deputation of Sisters was at once sent from
St. Mary’s Asylum in Natchez.</p>

<p>The Sisters were obliged to leave in the night in consequence
of a dispatch announcing the approach of the
Federal gun boat Essex, which might have prevented their
departure had they remained until the next day. Hence
they were compelled to cross the Mississippi River shortly
before the midnight hour. The good Bishop of Natchez,
now Most Rev. W. H. Elder, Archbishop of Cincinnati,
alarmed for their safety, determined to accompany them to
the post to which they were destined, and he did so. The
pastor of the church at Monroe was also one of the party.
The Sisters and their friends crossed the river in a skiff,
and, reaching the other side, found an ambulance awaiting
them. They traveled the remainder of that night and the
following two days over a very rough and dangerous road.
General Blanchard had a matron and nurses employed in
the hospital. He dismissed these and arranged with the
Sisters to take charge the day after their arrival.</p>

<p>Sister E&mdash;&mdash; had in her ward a convalescent patient
who, deeming himself of more consequence than the others,
was somewhat piqued at her for not showing him special
attention. The Sister kept him in his place and treated
him precisely as she did the others. One day she went
as usual to administer the medicines, and as she was passing
the ward in which he was located she heard him utter
most terrible oaths. She passed on quietly, but on her
return showed her displeasure at his disorderly conduct.
He made every apology for his misbehavior. The Sister
proceeded on her way, having a bottle in each hand. At a
very short distance from where the man was standing she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
stopped to say a few words to another patient. She happened
to look back and noticed the convalescent man put
his hand in his coat pocket, and at the same instant the
crack of a pistol shot was heard. The ball passed through
the front of the Sister’s cornette, within an inch or two of
her forehead. The poor man with whom the Sister
had been talking thought he was wounded
again, jumped up and clapped his hands on his old wound,
as if to assure himself of its escape from harm. The Sister,
pale, but with perfect presence of mind, still held her bottles
and made her way through the cloud of smoke and
the crowd that had gathered at the report of the pistol.
The man was arrested and would have been dealt with in
a summary manner, but at the request of the Sister he was
released. He claimed that it was an accident. It was afterwards
discovered that he was a gambler and had loaded
the pistol to shoot an enrollment officer in town.</p>

<p>In the meantime things were reaching a crisis in the
city of Natchez. One morning the sound of a shell bursting
over the town filled the people with consternation. The
scene that followed is beyond description. Women and
children rushed through the streets screaming with terror.
The asylum was thronged by persons of every description,
who begged to be admitted within its walls. One
of the Sisters speaking of this says: “I can never forget
the anguish I felt at the sight of mothers with infants in
their arms begging us to preserve the lives of their little
ones, without a thought about their own safety. At the
sound of the first shell our good Bishop hastened to the
asylum to assist us in placing the children out of danger
of the shells. The Bishop was surrounded as soon as he
appeared and nothing could be heard but cries of ‘Oh,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
Father, hear my confession,’ and ‘Bishop, baptize me. Do
not let us be killed without baptism.’ The Bishop kindly
went into the confessional, but soon perceived that he
would be detained there too long; therefore he requested
the Sisters to assemble all in the chapel and he would give
a general absolution, as the danger was so imminent. Immediately
their cries and sobs were suppressed. The
Bishop, after a few touching words, bade us remember
that no shell could harm the least one among us without
the Divine permission. He then gave a general absolution
to all present.”</p>

<p>Shells passed over the building in rapid succession
while the Sisters were kneeling in the chapel. Some of
the bombs fell in the adjoining yard, yet not one of those
in the asylum was injured. Within the silence of death
reigned. No sound was heard but the fervent aspirations
of the Bishop and the suppressed sobs of the smaller children.
Giving the final blessing the Bishop said: “Tell the
Sisters to take the children away as soon as possible.”
When all were in readiness each of the orphans, with a
bundle of clothing, passed out of the asylum with the
thought that they were never again to enter its loved
walls. Five of the Sisters accompanied them, and the others,
with two sick children, followed in a market wagon,
the only vehicle that could be procured. While the Sisters
were placing the smaller children in the wagon a shell
passed over the horse’s head, so near as to frighten and
cause the animal to jump, but it fell some distance away
without exploding. The poor children had to go five miles
without resting, so great was the danger. After remaining
some weeks in the country the authorities compromised,
and the gunboat left the city without doing any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
further damages. The Bishop announced the Forty Hours’
Devotion in thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Good work was done in the Charity Hospital, New Orleans.
The Sisters of Charity had charge of this hospital
and attended many hundreds of the sick and wounded on
both sides. It was the same with the Marine Hospital of
New Orleans. The first act of one of the Sisters on entering
a ward in this hospital was to grasp a cup of water
from a nurse and baptize a dying soldier.</p>

<p>One Sister relates how she endeavored for a long time
to get a cot for a very sick patient who lay on the floor reclining
on his carpet bag. She finally succeeded, and then
persuaded a convalescent soldier to convey the sick man
to the cot. The patient was unwilling to go without his
carpet bag and his boots, fearing they would be stolen if
he left them. He kept a watchful eye on them all the time,
and the Sister, understanding the reluctant movements of
the patient, took up the carpet bag in one hand and the
boots in the other and followed. The poor man was very
much struck with the humility and charity of the Sister,
and said:</p>

<p>“The soldiers wonder how the Sisters can work so
hard without pay.”</p>

<p>The Sister replied: “Our pay is in a coin more precious
than gold; it is laid up in a country more desirable
than any that exists on this earth.”

<p>After the battle of Fredericksburg, in December,
1862, the Sisters who had been looking after the sick and
wounded in the hospitals near Richmond soon found their
labors reduced very materially.
The armies on both sides were becoming
more accustomed to the
hardships of the camps, and as a
result there was less sickness in
the various regiments. There had
also been a cessation of battles in
the vicinity of Richmond, and as a
consequence there were no wounded
men to care for. The Sisters, feeling that their usefulness
was at an end, called upon the officer in charge and
asked for passports in order that they might return
through the lines to their Emmittsburg home. The official
would not consent to their going away, claiming that he
knew they would be needed in other places in the near
future. This being the case, they remained.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>The next day a letter came from the military in Central
Georgia, begging for Sisters of Charity to be sent to
their hospital there. Five Sisters left for this place on
the night of February 24, 1863. A fierce battle had taken
place, rendering the services of the Sisters very necessary.
On the way, at many places where they stopped, there was
great curiosity at the sight of their peculiar garb. Upon
one occasion, having to wait two hours for a train, the curious
bystanders examined the Sisters closely, saying:</p>

<p>“Who are they?” “Are they men or women?” “Oh,
what a strange uniform this company has adopted.” “Surely
the enemy will run from them.”</p>

<p>Once or twice the crowd pushed roughly against the
Sisters, as though to see whether they were human beings
or not. A Sister spoke to a woman at the station, and
thereupon many in the crowd clapped their hands and
shouted: ‘She spoke! she spoke!’</p>

<p>At one of the towns where the Sisters stopped they
did not know where to look for lodgings. Acting upon the
first impulse, they went to the Catholic pastor’s residence
and inquired where they might be accommodated. The
good old priest, strange as it may seem, had never seen
their costume before, and as every day had its impostures
to avoid, he was reserved and cautious, even unwilling to
direct them to any house. At last his pity got the better
of his prudence and he said slowly: “I will show you
where the Sisters of Mercy live.” He took them there,
where the good Mother received them with open arms,
saying: “Oh, the dear Sisters of Charity. You are truly
welcome to my house.”</p>

<p>This lady had been kindly entertained some years before
by the Sisters of Charity at Baltimore. The poor,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
abashed priest had kept near the door, fearing he had put
trouble on the good Sisters of Mercy, but when he saw the
reception accorded the visitors he brightened up. Approaching
one of the Sisters with outstretched hands, he
said: “Oh, ladies, make friends; I thought you were impostors.”</p>

<p>Continuing the journey, one night a cry suddenly went
up: “The cars have gone through the bridge and we are
in the river.” The greatest excitement prevailed in the
train. Passengers rushed to and fro, falling over one another
in their confusion. The Sisters had gone through so
many exciting scenes during the war that they had
learned the value of retaining their presence of mind in
such an emergency. They remained still and soon learned
that the accident had not occurred to their train, but to
one coming in the opposite direction. Except by the help
of torches very little could be done until daylight. Two
of the Sisters, however, crossed to the other side of the
bridge and gave suitable attention to the sufferers, washing
and binding their wounds. None were killed or in serious
danger. By 12 o’clock the next day they reached a
town. No refreshments were to be had. The work of devastation
on the part of Sherman’s army had preceded
them. Fortunately a little basket of lunch, originally prepared
for five Sisters, offered some sustenance. The next
day the number of Sisters had increased to eleven and
several strangers also, with whom they shared their supplies.
At 9 o’clock the same evening a poor soldier near
them in the car said: “Oh, but I am hungry. I have not
had one crumb of food this day.”</p>

<p>Out came the magic basket and the sufferer was satisfied.
Immediately others asked for food. The two following
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
days the Sisters had the soldiers to supply besides
themselves, and yet the generous basket was true to all
demands. On the third day’s journey they reached their
field of labor. It was in the town of Marietta. A very fine
building had been prepared for hospital purposes, and the
whole place, with its wants and workings, was placed in
charge of the Sisters. Their trained hands soon reduced
everything to a system, and from that hour until its close
the affairs of the institution went like clockwork.</p>

<p>The Sisters were five weeks without having the opportunity
or facilities for hearing Mass. Two Sisters at
last went to Atlanta, where there were two priests, and
begged that they might at least have Mass at Easter,
which was then approaching. This was agreed to, and not
only the Sisters, but many poor soldiers made their Easter
duty. An earnest appeal was also made for a chaplain,
and “headquarters” appointed one. Before he arrived,
however, orders were given to remove, as the enemy was
advancing. The Sisters had just received many wounded
soldiers, and these men grieved bitterly when the religious
left them.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>On the 24th of May, in response to an urgent appeal,
the Sisters reached Atlanta, where nearly all the houses
were filled with the sick and wounded. Only tents could
be raised for the Sisters. They had five hundred patients
in the tents at the start, and large numbers were added
daily. The Sisters were provided with a little log house,
containing two small rooms. The mice ran over them at
night and the rain was so constant through the day that
their umbrellas were always in their hands. Two of them
became very ill. The surgeon told them to keep in readiness
for a move, but the patients were so happy and doing
so well under their care that he could not think of their
leaving at that time.</p>

<p>A poor man, badly wounded, had been very cross and
abusive towards the Sister who served him, but she increased
her kindness and on the surface did not seem to
understand his rudeness. At last he became very weak,
and one day when she was waiting on him she saw that
he was weeping. She said: “Have I pained you? I know
I am too rough. Pardon me this time and I will try to
spare you pain again, for I would rather lessen than augment
distress in this hour of misery.”</p>

<p>He burst into tears and said: “My heart is indeed
pained at my ingratitude towards you, for I have received
nothing less than maternal care from you, and I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
received it in anger. Do pardon me. I declare I am
forced to respect your patience and charity. When I came
into this hospital and found that the Sisters were the
nurses my heart was filled with hatred. My mind was
filled with prejudice&mdash;a prejudice which I confess was
inherited from those nearest and dearest to me. I did
not believe that anything good could come from the Sisters.
But now I see my mistake all too clearly, and in seeing
it I recognize the unintentional blackness of my own
heart. I have seen the Sisters in their true light. I see
their gentleness, their humility, their daily&mdash;aye, their
hourly sacrifices, their untiring work for others; in a word,
their great love for humanity. Forgive me if you can.”</p>

<p>This man soon after expired with the most edifying
sentiments upon his lips.</p>

<p>The Sisters were employed at Camp Dennison until
the hospitals there were systematized; then they went to
New Creek, Va., and Cumberland, Md. During Pope’s
campaign they followed Sigel’s corps in the ambulances.
After the battle of Stone River they went to Nashville
and took charge of Hospital 14, capable of accommodating
700 or 800 patients. The following document, written
on the occasion of the Sisters leaving Nashville, will show
the light in which they were regarded by the inmates of
the hospital. The paper was signed by two hundred and
thirty-six persons.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>General Hospital No. 14, Nashville, Tenn., November, 1863.</p>

<p>To the Late Superior and Sisters of Charity in Attendance
of Said Hospital:&mdash;The undersigned attaches
and patients in said hospital have learned with regret
that you contemplate leaving your present post of labor,
and the object of this is to express the hope that you may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
be induced to forego that intention, and kindly consent
to remain with us:</p>

<p>During your stay in the hospital you have been indeed
sisters to all the patients, and your uniform kindness
to all has endeared you to all our hearts.</p>

<p>Should you leave us we can only say that wherever
you may go you will bear with you the soldier’s gratitude
and our earnest hope and prayer is that in whatever field
you may labor in future you may be as happy as you have
been kind and charitable to us, and may heaven’s choicest
blessings be showered upon you for your kindnesses to
the poor sick and wounded soldier.</p></blockquote>

<p>Private William N. Nelson, Nineteenth Illinois Infantry,
writes that he was passing through the ward getting
signatures to the above petition when one poor fellow,
who was lying on the bed almost dead, aroused himself
and said: “I want to sign that paper. I would sign it fifty
times if asked, for the Sisters have been to me as my
mother since I have been here, and I believe had I been
here before I would have been well long ago. But if the
Sisters leave I know I shall die. This is the feeling of
every sick soldier under the care of the Sisters.”</p>

<p>On May 2, 1863, General Joseph Hooker, who had
succeeded Burnside, fought General Lee at Chancellorsville,
but was defeated. Lee followed up this victory by
crossing the Potomac at Harper’s Ferry, and marching
into Pennsylvania. The Union army under General Meade
advanced to meet him, and then came Gettysburg.

<p>What is now generally conceded to have been the
decisive battle of the Civil War was fought on the 1st, 2d
and 3d of July, 1863. It took place in and around Gettysburg,
a town located only about ten
miles north of Emmittsburg, the
mother house of the Sisters of Charity.
The Union army was under the
control of General George G.
Meade, and the Confederate forces
under General Robert E. Lee. Over
140,000 men were engaged in that
bloody struggle, which lasted until the
evening of the third day. The contending armies by their
movements advanced more and more toward the Sisters’
house in Maryland. The scene of this historic battle
covered an area of over twenty-five square miles. The
soldiers were so close to the Sisters’ house that the buildings
trembled from the fearful cannonading.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>On the morning of July 1, as the head of the One
Hundred and Seventh Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers,
Second Division, First (Reynolds) Corps was approaching
St. Joseph’s Academy near Emmittsburg the
soldiers were greeted with a remarkable and impressive
sight. A long line of young girls led by several Sisters of
Charity took their position along the side of the road and
at a word from the Sister in charge all fell upon their
knees and with upturned faces toward the vaulted skies
earnestly prayed for the spiritual and physical safety of
the men who were about to go into deadly battle. The
sight was at once solemn and inspiring in the extreme.
The roughest soldiers ofttimes have the tenderest hearts,
and this scene affected them more than they cared to
confess. In an instant the head of every soldier in the
line was bowed and bared, and remained so until the
prayer was finished. All instinctively felt that the prayers
of those self-sacrificing women and innocent children
would be answered. To many of the men it was a harbinger
of coming victory as certain as the sunshine that
smiled upon them on that beautiful July morning. The
scene was photographed upon the mind of many a veteran
and remained ever afterwards as one of the sweetest
memories of the war.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The night of the third day the rain fell heavily, and
it continued raining all the next day. On Sunday morning
immediately after Mass, Rev. James Francis Burlando,
with twelve Sisters, left Emmittsburg for the battlefield,
taking refreshments, bandages, sponges and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
clothing, with the intention of doing all that was possible
for the suffering soldiers and then returning home the
next evening.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> The roads previous to the rain had been
in a bad condition and the two armies had passed over
them with difficulty. But with the mighty rain the mud
became so thick that they were almost impassable. The
subdued Southerners having retired, their thousands of
dead and wounded were left on the field and in the barns
and farmhouses in the vicinity. Scouts of the North were
stationed here and there, prepared to meet and cope with
any eleventh hour surprises. One of these bands seeing
the Sisters’ carriages was about to fire on them, thinking
they were the ambulances of the enemy. The Sisters had
reached a double blockade of zigzag fence thrown across
the road for defensive purposes. The visitors wondered
whether they dare go around it by turning into the fields,
for in the distance they saw soldiers, half hidden in the
woods, watching them. Father Burlando put a white
handkerchief on a stick and holding it high in the air,
walked towards them, while the Sisters alighted and
walked about, so that the concealed soldiers might see
their white head-dress, known as cornettes. The men
viewed the priest sharply, for they had resolved to refuse
to recognize a flag of truce if it were offered, but the
sight of the cornettes reassured them. They met the
priest and, learning his mission, sent an escort with him
to open a passage for the Sisters through the fields. The
meek messengers of peace and charity soon came in sight
of the ravages of grim war.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>It was a sight that once seen was not soon to be
forgotten. Thousands of guns and swords, representing
the weapons of the living, the wounded and the dead,
lay scattered about. The downpour from heaven had
filled the roads with water, but on this awful battlefield
it was red with real blood. The night before the unpitying
stars shone down upon the stark forms of the flower
of American manhood. Hundreds of magnificent horses&mdash;man’s
best friend to the end&mdash;had breathed their last
and lay by the sides of their dead masters. Silent sentinels
upon horseback, as motionless almost as the dead
about them, sat guarding this gruesome open-air charnel.</p>

<p>With the first streak of gray dawn the work of interment
had begun. Bands of soldiers were engaged in
digging graves and others were busy carrying the bodies
to them. There was no attempt at system. Vast excavations
were made and as many bodies as possible placed
in them. The dead were generally buried where they
fell. In one trench at the foot of the slope known as
Culp’s Hill sixty Confederates were buried. In that
three days’ fight 2834 Union soldiers were killed and
14,492 wounded. On the Confederate side there were
5500 killed and 21,500 wounded. Thousands of the slightly
wounded cared for themselves without the assistance of
either doctor or nurses. Thousands of others were shipped
to the Satterlee Hospital, in West Philadelphia,
where their wants were looked after by the Sisters of
Charity in that institution. The remainder were forced
to remain in Gettysburg.</p>

<p>This was the condition of things that confronted the
brave Sisters as they rode over the battlefield on that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
scorching July day. Frightful as it may seem, their
carriage wheels actually rolled through blood. At times
the horses could scarcely be induced to proceed on account
of the ghastly objects in front of them. The sight of
bodies piled two and three high caused the animals to
rear up on their hind legs and kick over the traces in a
most uncomfortable manner. In the midst of the sickening
scenes the Sisters discovered one little group sitting
about an improvised fire trying to cook some meat. The
carriage was directed to this point and here again Father
Burlando informed the soldiers of his errand. The officers
seemed well pleased and told the Sisters to go into
the town of Gettysburg, where they would find sufficient
employment for their zealous charity. Every large building
in Gettysburg was being filled as fast as the wounded
men could be carried in. Within and around the city one
hundred and thirteen hospitals were in operation, besides
those located in private houses. On reaching Gettysburg
the Sisters were shown to the hospital, where
they distributed their little stores and did all they could
to relieve and console the wounded soldiers.</p>

<p>Two of the Sisters returned to Emmittsburg that
same evening with Father Burlando, for the purpose of
sending additional nurses to relieve those already on the
ground. On arriving at the first hospital the surgeon in
charge took the Sisters to the ladies who had been attending
there and said to them: “Ladies, here are the
Sisters of Charity come to serve our wounded; they will
give all the directions here; you are only required to observe
them.” Those addressed cheerfully bowed their
assent.</p>

<p class="caption">GENERAL MEADE AT GETTYSBURG.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p></div>

<p>The soldiers seemed to think that the presence of
the Sisters softened their anguish. One Sister was giving
a drink to a poor dying man with a teaspoon. It was
slow work and a gentleman who entered unobserved at
the time stood near by without speaking for some moments.
This gentleman was from a distance and was
in search of the very person the Sister was serving. Standing
a moment in silence, he exclaimed in a loud voice:
“May God bless the Sisters of Charity,” and repeated it
emphatically, adding: “I am a Protestant, but may God
bless the Sisters of Charity.”</p>

<p>The Catholic Church in Gettysburg was filled with
sick and wounded. The stations of the cross hung around
the walls, with a very large oil painting of St. Francis
Xavier holding in his hand a crucifix. The first man put
in the sanctuary was baptized, expressing truly Christian
sentiments. His pain was excruciating and when sympathy
was offered him he said: “Oh, what are the pains I
suffer compared with those of my Redeemer.” Thus disposed
he died. The soldiers lay on the pew seats, under
them and in every aisle. They were also in the sanctuary
and in the gallery, so close together that there was
scarcely room to move about. Many of them lay in their
own blood and the water used for bathing their wounds,
but no word of complaint escaped from their lips. Others
were dying with lockjaw, making it very difficult to administer
drinks and nourishment. Numbers of the men
had their wounds dressed for the first time by the Sisters,
surgeons at that juncture being few in number.
When the Sisters entered in the morning it was no uncommon
thing to hear the men cry out: “Oh, come, please
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
dress my wound,” and “Oh, come to me next.” To all the
pain suffered by the soldiers was added the deprivations
of home friends and home comforts, which in such times
come so vividly to the mind.</p>

<p>Four of the Sisters attended the sick in the Transylvania
College building, which for the time being was
used as a prison for about six hundred Confederate soldiers.
The Sisters dressed their wounds as in other cases.
Every morning when they returned, eight or ten dead
bodies lay at the entrance of the college awaiting interment.
Two youths lay in an outstretched blanket and a
little ditch two inches deep was around the earth they
lay upon, to prevent the rain from running under them.</p>

<p>There was quite a sensational scene in this prison
one morning. One of the Sisters hearing a great noise
among the patients looked to see the cause. She discovered
a group of men with guns aimed at one poor, helpless
man. There had been a quarrel, and no one attempted
to stop the strife. The Sister promptly and with no
thought of personal danger hurried over to the group and
placed her hand on the shoulder of the prospective corpse.
Then she pushed him back into the surgeon’s room, holding
her other arm out to hinder the men from pursuing
him. There was a dead silence. The poor man was put
safely inside the doctor’s room and his tormentors retired
without a word, quietly putting away their guns. The
silence continued for some time. The Sister placidly resumed
her duties in the mess room.</p>

<p>Presently the doctor came to her and said: “Sister,
you have surprised me. I shall never forget what I have
witnessed. I saw their anger and heard the excitement,
but feared that my presence would increase it. I did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
not know what to do, but you came and everything was
all right. Indeed, this will never die in my memory.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the Sister calmly, “what did I do more
than any other person would have done? You know they
were ashamed to resist a woman.”</p>

<p>“A woman!” exclaimed the doctor; “why, all the
women in Gettysburg could not have effected what you
have. No one but a Sister of Charity could have done
this. Truly it would have been well if a company of Sisters
of Charity had been in the war, for then it might not
have continued so long.”</p>

<p>One young man after being baptized requested the
Sister to stay with him until he died. He prayed fervently
until the last breath, and almost his final words
were: “Oh, Lord, bless the Sisters of Charity.” This
brought a crowd around him, as his bed was on the floor.
The Sister was kneeling by him and continued to pray
for him until the last; then she closed his mouth and
bandaged his face with a towel, in the usual manner. They
who stood near said one to another: “Was this man her
relative?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply; “but she is a Sister of Charity.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said one of the company, “I have often heard
of the Sisters of Charity, and I can now testify that they
have been properly named.”</p>

<p>The surgeon remarked to the religious: “Sisters, you
must be more punctual at your repast. I see you are often
here until 4 o’clock in the afternoon without your dinner,
working for others with a two-fold strength. Where it
comes from I do not know&mdash;forgetting no one but yourselves.
You should, however, try to preserve your own
health.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>A Protestant gentleman remarked to one of the
Sisters that “the Sisters of Charity have done more for
religion during the war than has ever been done in this
country before.”</p>

<p>Both the Catholic church and the Methodist church
in Gettysburg were used for hospital purposes. One day
a Sister from the Catholic church had ordered her supplies,
as usual, from the sanitary store. Soon after this a
Sister who was nursing the sick in the Methodist church
called at the store and as she was about to leave the merchant
said:</p>

<p>“Where are these articles to be sent? I believe that
you belong to the Catholic church.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the Sister, with a barely suppressed
smile. “I belong to the Methodist church. Send the goods
there.”</p>

<p>After the more severely wounded had been removed
by friends, or had died, the officers began directing the
work of transferring the remaining patients from the
town hospital to a wood of tents, called the general hospital.</p>

<p>A Sister was passing through the streets of Gettysburg
about this time when a Protestant chaplain, running
several squares to overtake her, said:</p>

<p>“I see Sisters of Charity everywhere but in our general
hospital. Why are they not there?”</p>

<p>The Sister told him that when the wounded men had
been removed none of the surgeons or officers had asked
them to go there or they would have gone willingly.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I will go immediately to the provost
and ask him to have you sent there. I feel sure that he
needs you there.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>In going over the field encampment one of the Sisters
was pleased and saddened to find her own brother,
whom she had not seen for nine years. He had been
wounded in the chest and ankle and was in one of the
hospitals in the town. The meeting under such circumstances
was an affecting one. Both were devoted, loyal
souls, each doing duty earnestly according to his or her
knowledge of the right. Through the kindness of the
officer of the day the wounded man was permitted to be
removed to the hospital where his sister was in charge.</p>

<p>A few days after the battle of Gettysburg Father
Burlando wrote a letter to one of his reverend colleagues
in Maryland. Some of the facts mentioned in this document
have already been told in this chapter, but the fact
that it was written while the echoes of that famous fight
were still fresh makes it of unusual interest. It is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
Emmitsburg, July 8, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>Rev. and Dear Sir:&mdash;You have been informed without
doubt by the papers that we have been visited by
the Army of the Potomac, and that very near us has
been fought a terrible battle, the most bloody since the
secession. St. Joseph has well taken care of his house,
and St. Vincent of his daughters; we have not been troubled,
or at least we have escaped with the slight loss of
a little forage and some wooden palings, which have
served for the wants of a portion of the army.</p>

<p>The evening of the 27th of June the troops commenced
to appear upon a small hill a little distance from
St. Joseph’s. Regiment after regiment, division after
division, all advanced with artillery and cavalry, and
taking possession of all the heights encamped in order
of battle. The 28th, 29th and 30th we were completely
surrounded. General Howard and his suite took possession
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
of our house in Emmitsburg; General Schultz and
his suite were close to St. Joseph’s, in the house which
served some time since for an orphanage; the other
Generals took quarters in different houses along the line
of army.</p>

<p>For the protection of St. Joseph’s General Schultz
gave orders that guards should be posted in its environs,
and General Howard did the same for our little place in
Emmittsburg. A great number of officers asked permission
to visit the house, and all conducted themselves with
courtesy, expressing gratitude for the services rendered
the soldiers in military hospitals by the Sisters.</p>

<p>On Monday this portion of the army departed, and
was replaced by another not less numerous, which ranged
itself in line of battle as the first. A colonel of artillery,
Mr. Latrobiere, with other officers quartered in the orphanage;
he also visited the Institution. The Sisters distributed
bread, milk and coffee.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July the battle commenced about seven
miles from Emmittsburg. Whilst the booming of the cannon
announced that God was punishing the iniquities of
man our Sisters were in church praying and imploring
mercy for all mankind.</p>

<p>On Sunday I accompanied eight Sisters bearing medicaments
and provisions for the wounded. At the distance
of six miles we were stopped by a barricade, and
at about three hundred yards there was another to intercept
all communication. At the second was stationed a
company of Federal soldiers, who perceived us from afar.
I descended from the carriage, and raising a white handkerchief
advanced to the second barricade, and announced
the purpose of our errand. Immediately several soldiers
were sent to open the way, and the two vehicles continued
their route without danger. At some distance we found
ourselves again in face of another barricade, which compelled
us to make a long circuit. Behold us at last upon
the scenes of combat&mdash;what a frightful spectacle! Ruins
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
of burned houses; the dead of both armies lying here and
there; numbers of dead horses; thousands of guns, swords,
vehicles, wheels, projectiles of all dimensions, coverings,
hats, habiliments of all color, covered the fields and the
road. We made circuits to avoid passing over dead bodies;
horses, terrified, recoiled or sprang from one side to the
other. The further we advanced the more abundant were
the evidences presented of a terrible combat, and tears
could not be restrained in the presence of these objects
of horror. At last we halted in the village of Gettysburg.
There was found a good portion of the Federal army in
possession of the field of battle. The inhabitants had but
just issued from the cellars wherein they had sought
safety during the engagement. Terror was still painted
upon their countenances. All was in confusion, each
temple, each house, the Catholic church, the Court House,
the Protestant Seminary were filled with wounded, and
still there were many thousands extended upon the field
of battle nearly without succor. I placed two of our Sisters
in each one of the three largest improvised hospitals,
offered some further consolations to the wounded and then
returned to St. Joseph’s.</p>

<p>The next day I started with more Sisters and a reinforcement
of provisions. Meanwhile provisions had
been sent by the Government, and the poor wounded succored,
and the inhabitants having recovered from their
terror have given assistance to thousands of suffering and
dying. Eleven Sisters were now employed in this town
transformed into a hospital. We shall send some Sisters
and necessaries to-morrow if possible. Whilst I write
you the sound of cannonading re-echoes from the Southwest,
where another engagement takes place. My God,
when will you give peace to our unhappy country?</p>

<p class="caption">SISTER GONZAGA.</p></div>

<p>As stated in the previous chapter many car-loads of
wounded soldiers were conveyed from Gettysburg to the
Satterlee Hospital in Philadelphia. Sister Mary Gonzaga,
who was in charge of this institution,
deserves special
mention in connection with
her work during the war. If
nobility of character, earnestness
and purity of purpose,
great natural executive ability,
together with unaffected
piety and humility tell for
anything, this Sister will rank high in the bright galaxy
of self-sacrificing women whose lives have illumined the
history of Catholic Sistershoods in the United States.
Celebrating her golden jubilee, April 12, 1877, she could
even then look back over a series of years in the course
of which she has been school teacher, nurse, Mother Superior,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
*head of a large orphan asylum and the executive
of a great military hospital, where nearly 50,000 sick
and wounded soldiers received the self-sacrificing attention
of a staff of sixty or seventy Sisters of Charity.
Sister Gonzaga, just before her death, was credited
with being the oldest living Sister of Charity in the
United States. She spent the tranquil evening of a
busy and eventful life as the Mother Emeritus of St.
Joseph’s Orphan Asylum, one of the magnificent charities
of the City of Brotherly Love.</p>

<p>This venerable woman’s name in the world was Mary
Agnes Grace. She came from a respected Baltimore family,
being born in that city in 1812. She was baptized in
St. Patrick’s Church, and there and in a Christian home
received her preliminary religious training. In December,
1823, she was sent to St. Joseph’s Academy, Emmitsburg,
Md., where she proved to be a most diligent pupil.
The four years she spent in this institution helped to
make that certain foundation upon which her subsequent
successful career was built. She had early conceived the
idea of retiring from the world and devoting her life entirely
to the service of God. Accordingly, on March 11,
1827, she was received into the community of the Sisters
of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul. In April, 1828, in
company with two other Sisters, she opened a school in
Harrisburg. On the 25th of March, 1830 she made her
holy vows.</p>

<p>In May, 1830, Sister Gonzaga was sent to Philadelphia
to St. Joseph’s Orphan Asylum, with which her future
was to be so intimately connected. The Asylum at
that time was situated on Sixth street, near Spruce,
adjoining Holy Trinity Church. On October 24, 1836, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
institution was removed to the site of the present asylum
at the southwest corner of Seventh and Spruce streets.
Four Sisters and fifty-one children comprised the population
then. The Sisters were Sister Petronilla, Sister
Theodosia, Sister Mary John and Sister Mary Gonzaga.
Sister Petronilla died on August 3, 1843, sincerely mourned,
and was succeeded by Sister Gonzaga, who remained
in charge until October, 1844. Here she went on with her
good work, placid and calm in the midst of the worrying
turbulence of anti-Catholic bitterness and persecution,
which at times threatened the lives of innocent women
and children. In the latter part of 1844 she was sent to
Donaldsonville, La., as assistant in the Novitiate, which
at that time was for the purpose of graduating Southern
postulants.</p>

<p>In the following year Sister Gonzaga was transferred
to New Orleans. On March 19, 1851, she returned to St.
Joseph’s Asylum in Philadelphia to re-assume her former
charge. In 1855 she was sent in an administrative capacity
to the mother house of the Order in France, where
she remained for a year, obtaining and imparting much
valuable information regarding the work and duties of
Sisters. In May, 1856, she returned to the United States,
going to St. Joseph’s, Emmittsburg where she filled the
office of Procuratrix. In January, 1857, she returned to
Philadelphia, taking charge of her old love, St. Joseph’s
Asylum, for the third time.</p>

<p>The beginning of the Civil War a few years later was
to mark one of the most eventful epochs in the career
of Sister Gonzaga, and to develop extraordinary gifts and
qualities of administration. The Satterlee Military Hospital
was established in Philadelphia. Dr. Walter F. Atlee,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
an honored physician of the Quaker City, felt that
the interests of the Government and of the soldiers would
be benefited if the Sisters of Charity were installed as
nurses in the army hospital. He had several interviews
with Surgeon-General Hammond and with the Secretary
of War, Edwin M. Stanton. As a result of this the Sisters
of Charity were invited to assume charge. On June 9,
1862, Sister Gonzaga, accompanied by 40 Sisters, assembled
from all parts of the United States, entered upon
the duties in the hospital. It is difficult to estimate the
good work done by the Sisters during the period they
spent in this place, which has been aptly styled the
“shadow of the valley of death.” In those three momentous
years the Sisters nursed and cared for upwards of 50,000
soldiers. Only those who have had the care of the sick
can begin to estimate the amount of ceaseless labor and
patience involved in such a vast undertaking. The sick
and wounded comprised both Union and Confederate soldiers.
The gentleness of the Sisters soon endeared them to
all under their charge.</p>

<p>In securing the necessary number of Sisters a requisition
was made by Surgeon-General Hammond for twenty-five
from the mother house at Emmittsburg. They were
sent to Philadelphia at once to take their places in
the new hospital. To quote one of the Sisters,
the place was so large that “they could
scarcely find the entrance.” The workmen about the
grounds looked at the Sisters in amazement, thinking perhaps
that they belonged to some flying artillery. At 12
o’clock they repaired to the kitchen for dinner, and by the
time this meal was finished they found plenty of work had
been planned for them. One hundred and fifty men who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
had been brought in were in the wards. All of the Sisters
went to work and prepared nourishment for the men,
most of whom looked at them in astonishment, not knowing
what kind of persons they might be, but among the
number was a French soldier named Pierre, who immediately
recognized the garb of the “Daughters of Charity.”
In a short time the number of patients was increased to
nine hundred.</p>

<p>On the 16th of August over fifteen hundred of the
sick and wounded were brought to the hospital, most
of them from the Battle of Bull Run or Manassas. Many
had died on the way from sheer exhaustion, others were
in a dying state, so that the chaplain was kept busy in
preparing the men for death. The wards being now
crowded, tents were erected in the yard to accommodate
over one thousand patients, for the Sisters at that time
had not less than forty-five hundred in the hospital. When
they first went to Satterlee their quarters were very limited,
consisting of one small room, about seven feet square,
which served as a chapel. Another, somewhat larger,
answered the purpose of a dormitory by night and community
room by day. Dr. Hayes soon supplied four more
rooms, one of which was for a chapel. The soldiers, who
were very much interested, took up a collection among
themselves and gave the money to the Sisters, requesting
them to purchase ornaments or whatever was needed for
the chapel. They did so at different times until they
finally had a good supply of everything that was necessary.
They even secured new seats and sanctuary carpet.
The men stipulated that when the hospital was
closed the Sisters should take everything for the
orphans.</p>

<p>In April, 1863, Rt. Rev. Bishop Wood administered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
the sacrament of Confirmation in the little chapel to
thirty-one soldiers, most of whom were converts and
two of whom were over 40 years of age. In
February, 1864, forty-four others received the
sacrament of Confirmation. One man was unable
to leave his bed, and the Bishop was kind
enough to go to the ward in his robes to confirm the man.
After the ceremony the prelate distributed little souvenirs
of his visit and then asked the Catholics who were present
to approach the railing of the altar. To his great astonishment
as well as satisfaction all in the chapel came forward.
He gave a little exhortation and then dismissed
them. Mass was said at 6 o’clock in the morning, and
many of the patients were in the chapel at half-past four,
in order to secure seats. This was generally the case on
great festivals, although some of the crippled men had
to be carried in the arms of their comrades. At 3 o’clock
on Sundays and festivals Vespers were sung in the chapel,
in which the patients felt quite privileged to join. In Lent
they had the Way of the Cross, and in May the devotions
of the month of Mary. The chapel was always crowded
at these times. The soldiers took great delight in decorating
the chapel at Christmas with green boughs, festooned
with roses; indeed, it always gave them great pleasure to
help the Sisters in any kind of work, and they often interfered
when they found their kind nurses engaged in laborious
duties. In May, 1864, a Jubilee was celebrated at
the hospital with great success.</p>

<p>Cases of smallpox had occurred in the hospital from
time to time, but the patients were removed as soon as
possible to the smallpox hospital, which was some miles
from the city. The poor men were very much distressed
because they were compelled to leave the Sisters. It was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
heartrending when the ambulances came to hear the
men begging to be left at Satterlee, even if they were entirely
alone, provided the Sisters were near them. The Sisters
offered their services several times to attend these
poor men, but were told that the Government had ordered
them away to prevent the contagion from spreading. At
last the surgeon in charge obtained permission to keep
the smallpox patients in a camp some distance from the
hospital. The tents were made very comfortable, with
good large stoves to heat them. The next thing was to
have the Sisters in readiness in case their services should
be required. Every Sister was courageous and generous
enough to offer her services, but it was thought prudent
to accept one who had had the disease. From November,
1864, until May, 1865, there were upwards of ninety cases.
About nine or ten of these died. Two of the men had the
black smallpox, and were baptized before they expired.
The Sisters had entire charge of the poor sufferers, as
the physicians seldom paid them a visit, permitting the
Sisters to do anything they thought proper for them. They
were much benefited and avoided being marked by drinking
freely of tea made of “pitcher plant.” The patients
seemed to think the Sisters were not like other human
beings, or they would not attend to such loathsome and
contagious diseases.</p>

<p>One day a Sister was advising an application for a
man who had been poisoned in the face. He would not see
the doctor because, he said, he did not do him any good.
The Sister told him that the remedy she advised had cured
a Sister who was poisoned. The man looked astonished
and said: “A Sister?” She answered, “Yes.” “Why,” he
said, “I did not know that Sisters ever got anything like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
that.” She told him that they were human beings and
liable to take diseases as well as anyone else. “But I believe
they are not,” he said, “for the boys often say they
must be different from anyone else, or from other people,
for they never get sick and they do for us what no other
person would do. They are not afraid of the fever, smallpox
or anything else.” The men had more confidence in
the Sisters’ treatment than in that of the physicians’. The
doctors themselves acknowledged that they would have
lost more of their patients had it not been for the Sisters’
watchful care and knowledge of medicine.</p>

<p>One occurrence will show the good feeling of the men
towards the Sisters. One of the convalescent patients had
been in town on a furlough, and while there had indulged
too freely in liquor. On his return he went quietly to
bed. A sister, not knowing this, went with his medicine
as usual and touched his bedclothes to arouse him. The
poor man, being stupid and sleepy, thought his comrades
were teasing him, and lifting up his arm gave a terrific
blow, sending the Sister and medicine across the room.
Several of the convalescent patients seized their comrade
by the collar, and would surely have choked him to death
if the Sister had not compelled them to desist. However,
he was soon reported by the men and sent under an escort
to the guard house, where stocks were prepared for
him.</p>

<p>Nothing could be done for his release, as the surgeon
in charge was absent. As soon as that official returned
the Sister begged that the poor man might return to his
ward and be also free from all other punishment, as well
as from imprisonment in the guard house. The surgeon
complied with the Sister’s request, but in order to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
a strong impression on the soldier he dispatched an order
to all the wards, which was read at roll call, as follows:
“This man was released only by the earnest entreaty of
the Sisters; otherwise he would have been punished with
the utmost severity.” When the poor man came to himself
and learned what he had done he begged a thousand
pardons and promised never to take liquor again.</p>

<p>The following notes from the diaries of the Sisters are
of interest:</p>

<p>“From our taking charge of the hospital, June the
9th, 1862, until we left it, on August 3, 1865, ninety-one
Sisters had been on duty there. The war being over in
April, 1865, the Government only desired our services after
that until the convalescents could obtain their discharge.
The physicians, however, requested us to remain until
all the sick were removed to the Soldiers’ Home, or returned
to their own homes. I am happy to be able to
state that during our whole sojourn at Satterlee Hospital
there never was an unpleasant word between the physicians
or officers and the Sisters. The eve of our departure
the executive officer said to me: “Sister, allow me
to ask you a question. Has there ever been any misunderstanding
or dissatisfaction between the officers and
the Sisters since you came to this hospital?” I answered:
‘Not at all.’ ‘Well,’ he said, ‘I will tell you why I asked.
The other evening we were at a party. The conversation
turned on the Sisters in the hospitals, and I said there
had never been a falling out between us at Satterlee&mdash;that
we were all on the same good terms as on the first
day we met. Some of the city hospital doctors said they
did not believe that forty women could live together without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
disputing, much less that they could be among
such a number of men without it.’</p>

<p>“Among the soldiers, who were of many nations,
there was a large number of Indians. In Ward 20 there
was a young Indian names James Wise, who was far
gone in consumption. The doctors thought he could not
live very many days. A Sister sent for Charles Corbin, another
Indian, who was in Ward U, to speak to him of his
condition. Charley was a well-instructed Catholic, and
understood the French language, through which he communicated
to Sister the dispositions of the poor sufferer,
who did not know that he had a soul, or that there was
a God. In fact, to use Charley’s own words, ‘he was a
perfect savage.’ He would not listen to anything Charley
had to say, either in regard to the existence of a God or
the immortality of the soul. On leaving him for the night
Charley told Sister what little hope there was of his
conversion. But how mysterious are the ways of God!
On his return next morning he found him with very
different dispositions. The poor, sick one had had a
dream, which he relates as follows: He had thought he
saw our Lord coming toward him with a priest ready
to baptize him, thinking he was an infant and heaven
was open to receive him. This he described to Charley
as minutely as if he had seen the priest in reality, at
the same time requesting him to bring him to the chapel
to be baptized. The next time Father McGrane came
to say Mass Charley brought his ‘poor little savage,’ as
he still called him, although he was almost too weak to
walk, to the chapel. Here there followed a scene which
I must describe. Three interpretations were needed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
order to perform the ceremonies of administering the
Sacrament of Baptism. First Charley, who understood
the Indian language, interpreted it to Sister in French;
then Sister translated the French into English for Father
McGrane, who thus learned the desire of the ‘little savage,’
the third in the circle. He lingered for two weeks
after his baptism and was interred in Cathedral Cemetery.
Since his death Charley has often expressed the
wish to be one day as happy as he believes him to be.
May he rest in peace.</p>

<p>“September 27.&mdash;Quite an excitement was created
about 2 o’clock on the 27th of September, caused by the
visit of Generals Sigel and Hammond. The former lost
a leg in one of the late battles of Gettysburg and has been
since that time under the care of the Sisters in Washington.
He is now able to go about on crutches. Dr. Hayes,
with the principal surgeons, accompanied them in walking
the circuit of the hospital. The patients, who were
all eager to see once more their good old generals, who
had stood by them so valiantly in the terrible engagement,
came out of the wards as best they could, many
of them also on crutches, and crowded in the corridors
to cheer and welcome them as they passed along. One
poor young lad, Who was very sick, who Sister thought
would feel the privation of not being able to see them,
replied to her words of consolation: ‘Do not feel sorry on
my account. I would any time rather see a Sister than
a general, for it was a Sister who came to see me when
I was unable to help myself, in an old barn near Gettysburg.
She dressed my wounds and gave me drink, and
took care of me until I came here.’ The poor boy is a
Protestant, and never saw a Sister before that time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p>“Thanksgiving Day.&mdash;Quite an interesting little party
assembled in the laundry yesterday evening. The poor
laundresses have been so very generous for some time
past that Sister N. consented to let them have a little
party as soon as Sister Gonzaga would return from St.
Joseph’s, where she had been for the last two weeks.
They came quite early yesterday morning and hastened
to finish all their work by noon; then washed and dressed
in all their finery, which they had brought with them
for the occasion. Sister N. arranged the tables, which
were covered with snow white cloths, upon which were
placed cakes, preserves, apples, candies, etc. In the
centre and at each end of the tables were placed handsome
bunches of flowers. The pitchers looked like silver
and the knives and forks looked as if they had never been
used. The tea set was white&mdash;in fine, everything looked
nice, and our poor washwomen were delighted. At 4
o’clock Sister N. informed them that everything was in
readiness, and sent for Sister Gonzaga, who opened the
afternoon with a few remarks. The doctor, whose duty
it is to prescribe for them, was present. Two of the
patients who have violins had been previously requested
to come and play for them, and they, with the exception
of two or three small boys, were the only men present.
They danced until nearly 7 o’clock. The old women gave
us Irish jigs and reels to perfection, while the younger
ones danced cotillions. There was not a loud or unbecoming
word spoken during the whole evening, and
they acted as nicely as might be expected from a better
class. They all seemed well pleased, and expressed their
thanks to the Sisters for honoring them with their presence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Sister Gonzaga said grace for them before taking
their places at supper, and afterward make a few pleasant
remarks, to which they listened with the greatest respect.
The doctors then took their leave, after having
expressed their thanks to the Sisters for having allowed
them the favor of being present, which they considered
a great compliment. After supper one of the girls, in
the name of all, presented Sister Gonzaga with a large
cake, nicely frosted. She was obliged to accept it, else
she would have wounded their feelings. They then bade
us good night at a quarter to 8, and returned to their
humble homes, well pleased with their evening’s entertainment.
I must not omit to tell you that they defrayed
the expense of all the refreshments themselves. Each
one contributed a little beforehand, for, of course, they
knew they could not have had it in any other way.”</p>

<p>The hospital was one of the largest in the country,
and everything was arranged on a generous scale. It was
not the cause of any wonder, therefore, when the wounded
were brought in by the car-loads. Sister Gonzaga always
recalled two events in the history of the institution
with particular distinctness; the first was after the battle
of Bull Run and the second the day following the battle
of Gettysburg. After the battle of Bull Run the soldiers
were brought to the hospitals by the hundreds. The time
of the battle of Gettysburg there was a terrible period of
suspense for the people of Philadelphia. They only knew
in a general sort of way that a battle was taking place
perhaps somewhere in the neighborhood of the State
Capital, but they had no information regarding the result,
or who was the victor or vanquished. The earliest information
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
came with the first consignment of wounded soldiers
to the Satterlee Hospital. The sick and wounded
from the blood-stained field of Gettysburg did not come
by the dozen or by the car-load or by the hundred, but
by the thousands. One careful estimate puts the number
at four thousand. Such an emergency as this naturally
tested the capacity of the women in charge, but Sister
Gonzaga came through the ordeal with flying colors. The
surgeon in chief of the hospital was Dr. Isaac Hayes, who
achieved much fame by his connection with the celebrated
Kane Arctic exploring expedition, and who afterwards
headed an expedition of his own. The wards of the hospital
were very commodious and comfortable, each one
accommodating at least seventy-five beds.</p>

<p>Dr. Hayes was as a kind father to the Sisters, consulting
them upon everything that would contribute to
their comfort and happiness. Through the kind offices
of Dr. Hayes and Dr. Atlee they secured a chaplain, Father
Crane, who said Mass for them once a week. In the early
part of the war many of the wounded soldiers were taken
to St. Joseph’s Hospital, where Sister Hillary was in
charge. The hospital was then located in a dwelling
house on Girard avenue, between Sixteenth and Seventeenth
street. After the battle of Bull Run about sixty
soldiers were cared for at St. Joseph’s Hospital. At the
same time St. Teresa’s Church, of which the venerable
Hugh Lane is pastor, was temporarily used as a hospital
for wounded soldiers. The Sisters from Emmittsburg, as
detailed in the previous chapter, did much good service
after the fight at Gettysburg, going directly from their
mother house in Maryland to the scene of the battle.</p>

<p>There is an old and very rare print of the Satterlee
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
Hospital still in existence. From this valuable documentary
evidence it is clear that the hospital occupied many
acres of ground. In order to reach the building it was
necessary to cross a bridge in the vicinity of South street.
In crossing this at the time the hospital was opened the
carriage containing a number of Sisters broke down and
they were compelled to walk the remainder of the distance.</p>

<p>During all the time of the war Sister Gonzaga remained
in charge of St. Joseph’s Asylum, which she
visited at regular intervals. At the close of the war she
returned to give her whole time to the Asylum; the other
Sisters returning to their various missions.</p>

<p>Sister Gonzaga has had frequent visits from grateful
soldiers who were nursed back to life through her Christian
devotion. One who heard of her serious illness a
few years ago called, and then, as the outpouring of a
grateful heart, sent the following letter to the Philadelphia
Evening Star as “A soldier’s tribute to the noble
work of Mother Gonzaga during the war:”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In your valuable paper dated yesterday the announcement
was made that Mother Gonzaga, in charge
of St. Joseph’s Orphan Asylum, southwest corner of Seventh
and Spruce streets, was lying dangerously ill. In
reciting her many acts of charity for the young orphans
under her care and protection, victims of epidemics, etc.,
during the many years of her life, you were not aware
that the short notice touched a tender chord of affection
in the breast of many a veteran of the late war.</p>

<p>“Mother Gonzaga was a mother of sixty thousand
soldiers, as patients under treatment in Satterlee United
States Army Hospital, Forty-fourth and Pine streets,
from 1862 until 1865. Those who were under her care,
no matter of what religion or creed, when they received
the midnight visits of Mother Gonzaga, her silent steps
after ‘taps’ and by the dim gaslight, will recognize her
familiar countenance surrounded by that white-winged
hood or cowl, just bending her form to hear the faint
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
breath or whisper of some fever patient or some restless
one throwing off the bed clothes; she kindly tucking
them in around his body as a mother would a child; then
a visit to the dying to give them expressions of comfort.
Those who recall these scenes I say think of her truly
as an angel of peace and sweetness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_159" src="images/i_159.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SISTER MARY GONZAGA.</p></div>

<p>“Administering medicine when required, loosening
a bandage or replacing the same, watching a case of a
sufferer in delirium&mdash;at all times annoying to those near
him&mdash;was her daily duty. To see her always calm, always
ready, with modesty and fidelity, faithfully performing
a Christian duty as an administering angel
when physicians, surgeons, friends and all human aid
had failed, was a beautiful sight. No poet could describe,
no artist could faithfully portray on canvas the
scenes at the deathbed of a soldier, that would convey
to those not having witnessed them the solemnity of the
quiet kneeling, the silent prayer, a murmur faintly heard
as a whisper, a Sister of Charity paying her devotion to
Him on high, and consigning the spirit of the dying soldier
to His care.</p>

<p>“As one of many thousands under her care I shall
always think of Mother Gonzaga as one of a constellation
of stars of the greatest magnitude&mdash;surrounded by
many others that were devoted servants, among whom I
would mention Dorothea Dix, Annie M. Ross, Hettie A.
Jones and Mary Brady. We soldiers cannot forget the
service they rendered.</p>

“J. E. MacLane.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 12th of, April, 1877, Sister Gonzaga celebrated
the occasion of her golden jubilee in the Sisterhood. On
the previous 19th of March she had attained her 50th
year in the community. On that day she received the
blessing of the Holy Father (Pope Pius IX), a gracious
act obtained for her at the suggestion of Rev. Father
Alizeri, C. M., a saintly man and a faithful missionary,
who has since gone to his reward. Bishops, priests, Sisters
and laymen vied with one another on this jubilee
occasion in showing the reverence and esteem in which
they held the simple religious woman who had gone about
doing good for so many years.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>Ten years later she was recalled to the mother house
at Emmittsburg by her superiors, who desired to relieve
her of her responsibility as the head of such a large institution.
Born to obedience she promptly responded to
the order, and left the house which had become as a home;
left friends who had become endeared to her, and left
orphans who truly regarded her as a mother. There was
not a murmur from this woman who was being taken
away from associations with which she had been lovingly
and intimately connected for nearly half a century.</p>

<p>Her Philadelphia friends, without solicitation and
spontaneously and simultaneously, addressed petitions to
her superiors requesting her return to the scenes of her
life’s labors. In the words of one who loved Sister Gonzaga,
“Heaven was stormed by fervent prayers for the
return of the Mother of the Poor.” She remained at Emmittsburg
for sixteen months, and at the end of that time
returned to Philadelphia. Her home-coming on the 20th
of December, 1888, was made the occasion of a great demonstration.
The Sisters, the orphans, the managers of
the asylum and a host of friends participated.</p>

<p>The actual extent of the good done by Sister Gonzaga
is scarcely realized by those who were about her. Many
of her charitable acts have been done quietly, even secretly.
There was one story with almost the pathos of a tragedy
in which she was concerned. The daughter of an
estimable family went astray, and the parents in the first
violence of their anger and grief turned her out of the
house. A few months passed, and then their sober better
judgment coming to the surface they attempted to find
and forgive the child they had disowned. But they searched
in vain, and finally almost in despair turned to Sister
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
Gonzaga. She had not the slightest clue to the missing
girl, but she pledged herself to bring her back. In a short
time she located the erring one in the insane ward of the
Philadelphia Hospital. She was a raving maniac. The girl
was restored to her remorseful parents, and by careful
nursing was gradually brought back to reason.</p>

<p>On another occasion when the Sister was missing for
an hour or so every day it was discovered that she was
in daily attendance on a poor woman who lay ill in a
small house in a street near by. Although this was
entirely foreign to her duties she regularly called and
washed and dressed the woman.</p>

<p>Sister Gonzaga departed this life on the morning of
October 8, 1897, in her room in St. Joseph’s Orphan Asylum
in Philadelphia. A piece of crape, on top of
which was fastened a bit of immaculate white ribbon,
fluttered from the bell on the door of the asylum on that
day to inform the passer-by that this marvelous woman
had gone to receive her reward.</p>

<p>The obsequies of Sister Gonzaga took place on the
morning of Tuesday, October 12th. On the evening before
this event countless numbers took a last farewell
of the devoted Sister. Hundreds of women and men
kissed her dead face as she lay in her coffin. They
kissed her hands, which held the Rosary, and about
which was twined the broad, purple ribbon of her
office as Superioress. Some of the women shed tears,
but the men seemed even more deeply affected.</p>

<p>On the morning of the funeral the body lay in state.
It was attired in the habit of the order, with a black
gown and the white headdress. Clasped in her hand
was a crucifix and rosary and a small roll of paper, on
which was written the vows that the deceased took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
when entering upon her work.</p>

<p>The casket was heavily trimmed in silver, and upon
the lid was a plate containing this inscription: “Sister
Mary Gonzaga, died October 8, 1897, aged 85 years.”
Near the top of the lid was a large silver cross, with a
figure of the crucifixion. Upon the head of Sister Gonzaga
there reposed a golden-leaved crown, that was presented
to her when she had been 50 years a Sister of
Charity.</p>

<p>There was a profusion of floral offerings tastefully
arranged about the head of the casket. In a prominent
place was a cross and crown from the “Children of
Mary,” a society composed of former inmates of St. Joseph’s
Orphan Asylum.</p>

<p>The body lay in the community room, beneath the
altar. Half a hundred Sisters of Charity were seated
along the side of the room. The entire apartment was
draped in black. By 10 o’clock, when the doors
were closed, several thousand persons had passed
around the casket. At length the hearse drew up before
the asylum, and eight students from St. Vincent’s Seminary
carried the coffin out to the street. A long procession
quickly formed and slowly the march to St.
Mary’s Church was begun, the route being down Spruce
to Fourth and up Fourth. Arriving at the church the
eight theologians again acted as pall-bearers, and the
casket was carried up the aisle and placed in front of
the altar.</p>

<p>Among the mourners were the Board of Managers
of the institution, Sisters of Charity from various houses
of the order in Philadelphia and other cities, Sisters of
other orders, the Children of Mary, composed of those
who were formerly inmates of St. Joseph’s Orphan Asylum,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
numbers of them now mothers of families, and the
orphans at present at the home. In addition to these a
large congregation was present, which crowded the
church.</p>

<p>Solemn Requiem Mass celebrated by Very Rev. J.
A. Hartnett, C. M., of St. Vincent’s Seminary, Germantown,
who celebrated his first Mass at St. Joseph’s Asylum
chapel. Rev. E. O. Hiltermann, rector of Holy
Trinity, was deacon; Rev. Edward Quinn, C. M., of Baltimore,
sub-deacon, and Rev. John J. Duffy, master of
ceremonies. Mr. John F. Walsh, a seminarian, was
thurifer. Bishop Prendergast, who occupied a seat on
the Gospel side of the altar, was attended by Rev.
James O’Reilly, of Downingtown, and Rev. T. B. McCormick,
C. M., of St. Vincent de Paul’s.</p>

<p>The sermon was delivered by Rev. John Scully, S. J.,
rector of St. Joseph’s, who spoke in substance as follows:</p>

<p>“St. Paul tells us in his first letter to the Corinthians
that the wisdom of this world is foolishness with
God, and in order that God may show to us that this is
so the same Apostle tells us that the base, the lowly
of this world and the contemptible hath God chosen
and the things that are not in order to confound the
things that are. How true in all ages have been these
inspired words of the Apostle! How true to-day. This
foolishness, this wisdom of the world, so foolish in the
eyes of God, differs in degree and kind in different ages.
In our age it shows itself in the attempt to divide human
philanthropy and brotherly love from religion.
Take the intellect and culture of this great city in which
we live, and what does it lay down as law, except it be
that mankind must practice altruism, as they call it,
brotherly love, the civic virtue by which alone society
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
among men can be made possible, yet not one word
about the essential basis which even the modern pagan
sees is necessary. When talking about our rights they
say nothing of the rights of God, and when talking of
our obligations to one another they say nothing of our
obligations to God, without which nothing can rest on
a solid basis.</p>

<p>“The wisdom of the world is foolishness. The lowly
are chosen by God to confound the worldly wise. In
the days of old God raised David from the shepherd of a
flock to be the ruler of His people. Christ chose the
poor fishermen to be His Apostles. He called St. Vincent
de Paul from the lowly occupation of a shepherd
to be a wonder-worker, a marvel, a propagator of charity,
not only in his own days, but up to the present
time. How many millions of dollars are spent in the
spirit of modern philanthropy? For education, in order
to raise men up as they think, to give men a chance in
life. Because it is divided from religion it falls. The
late Mr. Vaux said on what was perhaps his last official
visit to the penitentiary: ‘When I first came here I found
the children of the poor and the ignorant. Now I find
my own schoolmates.’ Thus are spent millions in charity,
or rather in almsgiving, for it is not worthy to be
called charity. What is the result? It puffs up one with
pride and another with envy.</p>

<p>“The reason why the thing is done differently is the
motive under the acts of thousands and tens of thousands
who have given up their lives to works of charity.
Have you ever heard of a soldier wishing to become
a member of a church to which a trained nurse belonged?
How different when the motive is that of Jesus Christ.
It is the experience of thousands who beg to be allowed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
to die in that religion of the devoted Sisters who
attended them, and it was this that caused a bishop to
receive a petition from a remote part of the diocese for
a priest to be sent there and a church built. He replied
that not only was he ignorant that so many Catholics
were there, but that there was even one Catholic. The
answer was, ‘There are no Catholics here yet, but we are
men who were attended by the Sisters and we want to
be of the religion of the Sisters.’ The base, ignoble and
contemptible things of this world has God chosen for
His work.</p>

<p>“What is more foolish in the eyes of the world;
what is more despised and held in contempt by the intellectual
and the cultured than poverty? Yet the Sisters
are bound by vows of poverty to be as poor as
Christ, to live a life of dependence, depending on one
another for their very food and raiment. What more
foolish in the eyes of the world than that! As the
wise man has said, they are a parable of reproach, looked
on with derision. What is more foolish, more base, more
spiritless, more contemptible than to find women, ladies,
willingly binding themselves, not by impulse, but by
vocation, not as a mere whim, but perpetually to live
by rule, doing that to which no man ever yet got accustomed,
to purify their acts to make them meritorious in
the sight of God? And obedience! The world hates
and loathes obedience, yet our Divine Lord was obedient
even unto death, the death of the cross.</p>

<p>“What is the result of all the so-called charity and
philanthropy? Nothing lasting. Search the hearts of
thousands of men, women and children who have been
benefited by the Sisters and you will find there the love
of God.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>“Such was the life of the devoted woman who spent
70 years doing good. Many philanthropists have monuments
raised to them and are looked upon as public
benefactors and honored as such. Take him or her who
was greatest among them, or all of them together, what
are all compared with a life such as hers, spent in the
care of the poor, sick and needy? One long life doing
good. A life not only an imitation of Jesus Christ in
its acts, but what is more necessary and more difficult,
a life in imitation of His motives. The world looks in
reproach upon such a life. How many times has she
been sneered at on the street in her poor dress and
strange bonnet! How often has the world looked with
contempt on her that served the Lord so faithfully.
How He loved that soul that did as He did and for the
same reason. All I have said could be said of almost
any other Sister of Charity, but of her, who lived for
70 years in religion, how much could be said those only
can know who lived with her and knew her and loved her
the more they knew her. Of how few can this be said&mdash;to
have combined in one and the same person the power
of execution, the power of government, and at the same
time the spirit of kindness and of great-heartedness
which does not make commands ever necessary. Without
emotion, without anger. No one ever saw that
kindly face ruffled. This is rare in the world&mdash;yes, even
rare in the religious life. To speak of her life and to
realize that thousands and tens of thousands of orphans
have had her care, many becoming mothers of families
and bringing up their children influenced by her example.
To realize her hard work in the military hospital, to
think of the thousands and tens of thousands dealt with
directly by her or indirectly through her as superioress.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
What a world of well doing! Seventy years in religion;
85 years spent in the serving of Christ. What a wonderful
crown is won by her whose dead body is lying
here! Seventy years a member of the community whose
very name is held even by the enemies of her faith as a
synonym of all that is good in humanity&mdash;something
which raises humanity and brings it close to God.</p>

<p>“Now the reign of sorrow and desolation has passed
away. She has gone forth from the scene of her labor
to her rest. She has gone into the sight of Jesus
Christ, whom in life she made her Friend. Not to meet
the severe face of a Judge, but the smiling countenance
of a dear friend. Who would recall her? Not those who
loved her most, who lived with her in community; not
those who were the recipients of her bounty. What so
glorious as a death such as hers after 70 years in God’s
service. Says St. Hilary, ‘Shall I fear to die after I have
served my Lord for 70 years?’ So died she, because
she knew the good Master she served.</p>

<p>“As theologians tell us, God makes known to his
saints the needs of those whom they have left behind.
’Thou who knowest the needs of thy children be their
advocate and pattern now as ever in life. Be unto us
a mother and pray for us that we may go forth as thou
hast from this valley of affliction and tears to the sunshine
of God the Father, to live forever with His Son,
our Lord, Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>The absolution of the body was performed by Bishop
Prendergast, assisted by the officers of the Mass. The
music was the Gregorian chant, with the introit, offertory,
communion and “Benedictus” in harmony. This
was rendered by the students of St. Vincent’s Seminary,
Germantown. From among them were chosen the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
pall-bearers also. The prominent part taken in the services
by the Congregation of the Mission was due to the
fact that St. Vincent de Paul, its founder, was also
founder of the Sisters of Charity.</p>

<p>Eleanor C. Donnelly, the gifted Philadelphia poetess,
has written the following verses in memory of Sister
Gonzaga and inscribed them to Sister Mary Joseph and
her community, with affectionate sympathy:</p>

<p>Sister Gonzaga had a countenance of great benignity
and firmness. A high forehead, a kindly mouth and
eyes which even age was not able to dim. She was ever
a model of graciousness and good breeding. The effects
of a good education were visible, and the results of a
well-balanced and well-trained mind seen in a remarkably
accurate and strong memory. The story of her
life is well worth the telling, serving as it does as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
model and incentive for those who would be successful
in their chosen vocation.</p>

<p>This chapter upon Sister Gonzaga cannot be concluded
better than by the presentation of the roster of
Sisters of the Satterlee Hospital<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>. On the 9th of June,

<span class="large">THE FALL OF RICHMOND.</span></h2>

<p class="hang">Preparing for the close of the war. Sisters of Charity in the West enlisted
in the military prison at Alton. Smallpox cases removed to an island
in the Mississippi. Leaders of the Southern Confederacy realize that
their cause is lost. Scenes of wild excitement in Richmond. Blessings
for the Sisters.</p>

<div id="i_172" class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_172.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>General Grant, who had been laying siege to Vicksburg,
had captured that stronghold on the Fourth of July,
1863. Then came the surrender of Fort Hudson and the
battles of Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain
and Missionary Ridge.</p>

<p>Grant in 1864 was made Lieutenant-General
and placed in command of all the
armies of the United States. Early in
May he led the Army of the Potomac
across the Rapidan toward Richmond. For
six weeks he tried to get between Lee’s
army and Richmond without success. In
this fruitless effort he fought the battles
of the Wilderness, North Anna, Bethesda
Church and Gold Harbor, losing 40,000 men. Then he
moved his whole army south of the James and laid siege
to Petersburg.</p>

<p>The burning of Chambersburg by the Confederates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
and the valor of General Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley,
with Admiral Farragut’s achievements at sea, completed
the notable events of 1864.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1864 Sherman began his march to the
sea, which was unique in modern warfare, and was completely
successful. The last campaign began in the spring
of 1865. On April 1, 1865, Petersburg was evacuated, the
Union Army entered Richmond on the 2d. On the 9th of
April came the surrender of Lee to Grant at Appomattox,
which was the practical end of the war. Long before this
the Sisters of Charity felt that their work was drawing
to a close. In the meantime, however, their services were
being utilized in the West. Colonel Ware, who was then
in command of the prisons of that section, applied to the
Bishop of Alton, Ill., for the Sisters of Charity to attend
the prisoners at Alton. Accordingly, Bishop Yonker applied
to the Sister servant of St. Philomena’s School, St.
Louis. One of the Sisters was at that time in St. Louis
at the Gratiot State Prison Hospital. She received a dispatch
from Father Burlando to go to Alton and take with
her three Sisters. They started early the next morning,
March 15, 1864, and reached Alton in twenty-four hours.
There they were met by Father Harty, who conducted
them to the residence of a gentleman, a member of the
City Council.</p>

<p>Colonel Ware soon called to see them and accompanied
them to the prison, which had been formerly called
the Illinois State Penitentiary. It had been vacated before
the war for a more commodious and healthy locality.
Before reaching the main entrance the Sisters had to ascend
a very rugged road, well protected by guards. Here
a residence would have been provided for them, but they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
did not think it safe or prudent to accept it. They passed
through the yard, which was crowded with prisoners,
numbering four thousand Confederates and one thousand
Federals, the latter being confined there for desertion
and through follies committed in camp. The two parties
were separated, except in the hospital. The poor sick were
so delighted to see the Sisters that they could scarcely
contain themselves.</p>

<p>It is said that the men died in this hospital at the rate
of from six to ten a day. The place was too small for the
number of inmates, who were all more or less afflicted with
diseases. Some were wounded, other a prey to despondency,
typhoid fever and the smallpox; consequently the
atmosphere of the prison was very foul. Fortunately the
smallpox cases were removed to an island in the Mississippi
as soon as discovered. The Sisters made arrangements
with Colonel Ware to visit the sick twice a day.
As there were no accommodations for the Sisters to remain
in the prison they returned to the residence of Councilman
Wise, who had so kindly received them in the
morning. He could not accommodate them, but procured
lodgings for them in the house of his sister, where they
remained for nearly six weeks. On their return to the
prison the next day the Sisters found written orders from
the Government. They also met there the attending physicians,
who appeared glad to see them and said that
they hoped soon to see an improvement in the condition
of the sufferers, who had been heretofore much neglected.
The Sisters were informed that four of the patients had
died during the previous night. A place was allotted to
them to prepare drinks and nourishment for the sick.
It was an old workshop, and the floors were in such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
condition that the Sisters were continually in danger of
falling through. The attendants, who were prisoners,
were exceedingly kind and obliging, so much so that they
would even anticipate the wishes of the Sisters.</p>

<p>Two weeks had scarcely elapsed before the sick began
to improve. The doctors acknowledged a change for the
better, saying that there were fewer deaths, and that
despondency had nearly disappeared. A look of commiseration
or a word of encouragement soon made these
poor victims feel that they were cared for at least by the
lowly children of St. Vincent. The Sisters visited the
Federal Guards Hospital and the smallpox island hospital
at the request of Colonel Ware. They visited the Federal
Guards Hospital once a day and the smallpox island hospital
once a week, but even that consoled the poor patients,
as the Sisters provided them with delicacies and nourishment
they mostly craved.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May the Sisters took possession of a
house belonging to St. Joseph’s, Emmittsburg, that had
been previously occupied as a school, but was then vacated.
They were now one mile distant from the prison,
and an ambulance was sent daily to convey them to and
fro.</p>

<p>On July 1 they were notified that their services were
no longer required at the prison. They could do nothing
until the superiors were acquainted with their situation.
Meanwhile the citizens were anxious to have them
remain in Alton and convert their house into a hospital.
They soon received a letter from the venerated Mother
Ann Simeon, giving permission to open a civil hospital
for the citizens of Alton. One of the Sisters was sent to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
St. Joseph’s Hospital, Alton, to wait on the sick and
wounded soldiers from the battle of Winchester. There
was one man in the ward who was nicknamed “Blue
Beard,” from his ferocious manners and large mustache.
He would never ask for anything nor take anything offered
to him. One day when he was being urged to take
some nourishment he replied:</p>

<p>“Sister, I do not wish for anything that you have.
There is only one thing, and that I do not think you can
procure for me.”</p>

<p>The Sister inquired what it was and assured him that
if it were in her power she would get it for him. He then
replied:</p>

<p>“Sister, I should like to have a lily. I think it would
do me so much good.”</p>

<p>The wish was a strange one, nevertheless she at once
determined to gratify him, which the kindness of a friend
enabled her to do. This little act of kindness was not
without effect, and from that time the man had a high
regard for the Sisters.</p>

<p>At the termination of the war, in 1865, the prisoners
received their discharge. It was sad to see the streets of
the city lined with the ragged and distressed looking men.
The sick were brought to St. Joseph’s Hospital, which
was soon filled. The Sisters gave the soldiers the very
best attention and consideration, and within a few months
the majority of the men were enabled to return to their
homes and families.</p>

<p>The little band of Sisters who had been laboring in
Frederick City, Md., from 1862 to 1864 certainly did their
share in caring for helpless humanity. They were kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
actively employed in Frederick City during the summer
and autumn of 1862. They found then that their work
was not nearly done. The winter set in with heavy rains
and deep snow, to which they were constantly exposed. The
poor patients had likewise much to suffer from the badly
constructed buildings. The wind, rain and snow penetrated
through the crevices, leaving the poor men in a
most uncomfortable condition. This was called to the
attention of the chief surgeon, who immediately gave orders
for the dilapidated barracks to be repaired as much
as possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_177" src="images/i_177.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MULVANEY’S “SHERIDAN’S RIDE.”</p></div>

<p>Some of the soldiers were quite amusing with their
grateful intentions. A Sister was asked one day whether
she ever wore any other color but gray or black, “for,” he
continued, “I wish to present Sister Agnes with a new
dress; she has been so truly good to me.”</p>

<p>The soldiers seemed to have the greatest confidence
in the Sisters, whose advice they preferred before that
of the physicians. General Hunter had now received
command of the Shenandoah Valley. He visited the hospital
and issued an order that all the prisoners should
be placed by themselves in separate barracks entirely
apart from the Union men. Soon after the United States
surgeon in charge of the hospital inspected all the barracks
and found one filled with Confederates and with
no Sister to take charge of them. The sufferings of these
poor men touched him so much that he immediately went
to the Sister servant and requested her to send a Sister
from a ward of the Union soldiers to take care of the Confederates.
The patience of these poor sufferers was the
admiration of all. A worthy clergyman once remarked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
that in his visits to the hospital he was always edified
by their resignation. He said he had never heard the
least murmur escape their lips, and commenting upon
this he remarked: “I think the intensity of their pain,
both mentally and physically, might, if offered in unison,
expiate the sins of their whole life.”</p>

<p>About this time the leaders of the Southern Confederacy
began to realize that the clouds were gathering
about them and that their cause was hanging in the balance,
if indeed it was not already destined to failure.
They resolved to concentrate their hospital facilities in
and around the city of Richmond, Va. The Sisters who
had been doing work upon the various battlefields in the
South were summoned to the Southern Capital. The Sisters
had served at Harper’s Ferry, Manassas, Antietam,
Fredericksburg and White House, Va.</p>

<p>Those who were located in Richmond at this time
began to feel “in their bones” that the fall of the
city was imminent. They were right. The long expected
event occurred in April, 1865. Jefferson Davis, the President
of the Southern Confederacy, was at worship in an
Episcopal church when he was handed a telegram telling
him that Richmond must be evacuated. He presented a
calm exterior, but bad news is hard to conceal, and the exact
situation was soon noised about the city. The wildest
excitement prevailed. Men, women and children rushed
hither and thither, knowing not what to do or where to
go. Finally their frenzy assumed a decisive shape and a
general evacuation of the city began. The Sisters, who
constituted the calmest portion of the population, looked
on the scene with mild amazement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>The City Councils met and with the general interests
of the people in view determined to destroy all the liquor
in Richmond. This work was begun at midnight and
before the first gray streaks of dawn revealed the terror-stricken
city to the public gaze the streets and gutters
were running with veritable lakes of whisky, wine and
beer. Many of the soldiers and some of the residents
balked the good intentions of the Councils by drinking
the liquor, and then scenes of drunken revelry were added
to the general confusion. Thieves broke loose, houses
were robbed, public buildings were fired and bridges
leading from the city were destroyed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foresight of the authorities on
the coming defeat, its arrival was most appalling. Medical
stores, commissary departments and other houses were
thrown open. The city was troubled from the blowing
up of the gunboats in the river. The Sisters were preparing
to go to Mass early in the morning when suddenly
a terrific explosion stunned, as it were, the power
of thought. The noise of the breaking of windows in the
hospitals and neighboring buildings added greatly to the
alarm. The Sisters soon learned that the Confederates
had blown up their supplies of powder which were very
near the hospital buildings; then followed an explosion
of all the Government buildings.</p>

<p>After the surrender a Federal officer rode up to the
door of the Sisters’ house and told them they were perfectly
safe, their property would be respected and that
he would send a special guard to protect their house. No
resistance was shown to the Union troops. The city was
placed under military rule and General G. F. Shepley made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
Governor. One thousand prisoners were found in the
city and five thousand sick and wounded were in the
hospitals. The prisoners were set free and the Sisters
with joy hailed the peace that was once again to dawn on
a blood-washed land. They remained in Richmond until
the sick and wounded were able to quit the hospitals and
then returned home to Emmitsburg, followed by the gratitude
and blessings of the men of both armies.</p>

<p>The soldiers who were in the Washington hospitals
also returned to their homes impressed with the kindest
feelings toward the Sisters. The officers and doctors all
concurred in expressing unlimited confidence in them.
Printed placards were hung in all the wards, reading:
“All articles for the use of the soldiers here are to be
placed in the care of the Sisters of Charity, as also papers,
books and clothing.”</p>

<p>Early in the summer of 1865 the Sisters took their
departure and the hospital was permanently closed. Another
hospital in Washington began its operations in
March, 1865, and closed in October of the same year. The
Sisters were placed in charge, and, since their customs and
calling were known, did not experience as much annoyance
as in the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>The house was well filled with the sick and wounded.
During the month of July the Jesuit Fathers were giving
a jubilee at their church in the city of Washington and
many of the convalescents attended.</p>

<p>The officers of the hospital expressed much gratitude
for all that had been done by the Sisters. The first surgeon
was at a loss to know how to put his satisfaction
into words, saying that the Sisters of Charity had marvelously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
lessened the cares of the physicians and surgeons
in all of the hospitals in which they served.</p>

<p>This concludes the story of the work done by the
Sisters of Charity of Emmittsburg from the beginning
to the close of the war. While they were at work, however,
the Sisters belonging to branches of the order and
to other orders were not idle, as will be seen by the chapters
that follow.

<p>The main body of the Sisters of Charity were not
alone in their devotion to the sick and wounded soldiers.
During the trying days between 1861 and 1865 no body
of men or women did more for suffering
humanity than the patient, zealous Sisters
of Charity of Nazareth, then, as
now, of Bardstown, Kentucky. A score
of Sisters in that community offered
themselves and their services without
pay and without hope of earthly reward
of any character. It was in the spring
of 1861, the opening year of the civil
war, that Bishop Martin John Spalding
sent a formal communication to General
Robert Anderson, of Fort Sumter fame,
then in command of the Department of Kentucky,
tendering the services of the Sisters of Charity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
of Nazareth to nurse the sick and wounded soldiers.
Their services were willingly accepted, and the understanding
was that the Sisters were to work in the hospitals
in and around Louisville.</p>

<p>Three large manufacturing establishments in the
city of Louisville had been placed at the service of the
Government and were being used as hospitals at that
time. The rooms were long, and lines of cots extended
along each side. The hospitals were divided into sections
and each section was placed under the watchful charge
of a Sister of Charity. The system that characterized the
three establishments was such that no sufferer was neglected
or without a nurse. This was in striking contrast
with the disorder and lack of system that had prevailed
prior to the advent of the Sisters. There were
twenty-three Sisters in the three hospitals, in charge of
an army surgeon, and they worked faithfully from their
entrance into the hospitals until the close of the war,
without a cent of compensation.</p>

<p>There had been one battle and several severe skirmishes
in Kentucky about that time, and when the Sisters
arrived at the hospitals the scene was enough to
bring tears into the eyes of the most hardened. A great
many Confederates had been captured and were being
held as prisoners of war. Within the walls of the hospitals
hundreds of Union men and Confederates lay
groaning in a common agony. Those that were not mortally
wounded and that had not submitted to the amputation
of a leg or an arm were raving in the worst forms
of fever or had contracted erysipelas, pneumonia and kindred
ailments. About it all there was a heroism that was
touching, and as the Sisters passed from cot to cot many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
a soldier suffering with a shattered limb or bullet-pierced
body lifted his wan face and gave forth a smile of welcome
and of recognition.</p>

<p>The Sisters soothed the restless patients, bathed the
fevered brows and moistened the parched lips “with a
touch impartially tender.” The attitude of the men themselves
was not without interest. Many of them had never
seen a Sister before; the majority of them looked upon
the Sisters with distrust and suspicion. The change that
came in a short while came as actual knowledge comes
when it dissipates prejudice and misrepresentation. They
could not help but be impressed with the quiet demeanor
and the self-sacrifice of the Sisters, and unreasoning dislike
and bigotry soon gave way to natural respect and esteem.</p>

<p>But the beauty of the Sisters’ lives, their habit of
thinking of all but themselves, had its effect upon many
a hardened sinner. Five hundred men died in “hospital
number one,” and of that number only one passed away
seemingly indifferent to his future.</p>

<p>An incident told by one of the surviving Sisters carries
a moral with it. One of the soldiers in the hospital, a
Catholic, refused to do anything for the benefit of his soul.
His end seemed to be approaching and he was transferred
to some other place, where he could be reasoned
into submission and repentance. A man who occupied
a cot near that of the unrepentant Catholic had heard the
Sisters pleading with him. He listened with a thoughtful
manner, and when the hard hearted man had been removed,
called a Sister to his side. He begged to be further
instructed in the Catholic faith. His request was
complied with, he was baptized, confessed, received Holy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Communion and finally died a most holy and edifying
death.</p>

<p>The parish priests of Louisville and several of the
Jesuit Fathers paid regular visits to the hospitals. Each
priest came on an average of three times a day, but there
was not a moment during the day or night when a priest
was not within easy call. The Sisters by their forethought
and intelligence made the work of the clergy comparatively
easy. A man who desired to be baptized was prepared
by the Sisters and ready when the priest arrived. Those
to whom it was necessary to administer the last rites of
the Church were gradually brought to realize the importance
of these rites by these same Sisters. So it was
from day to day, from week to week, from month to month.
The Sisters were unflagging in their devotion to the men
in their charge. They nursed, they prayed, they consoled,
in fact, as more than one grateful soldier exclaimed,
proved themselves little short of earthly angels.</p>

<p>A pathetic scene took place one day in “hospital number
two.” A young soldier, a Catholic and a Scotchman,
lay on his death-bed, far from home and family and country,
but surrounded by all the loving devotion of the Sisters.
He knew that his end was at hand and had been
prepared by all of the sacred rites of the Church for his
journey into the great unknown. He was slowly expiring
from a fatal wound and was unable to move.</p>

<p>In a feeble voice he asked the Sister to hand him a
package of letters that he had read over and over again,
and which he always kept in view. They were given him
and he read them over once again and for the
last time. After that he selected several from the
package and placing them close to his heart said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
slowly, but distinctly: “Sister, leave them here until
I am dead. That will not be long. Then send
them to my father and mother in Scotland. Tell them that
I thought of them until the last. Get the money that is
coming to me. Give some of it for Masses for an offering
for my soul and forward the remainder to my parents.
Now I am ready to die. Good-bye.” With a faint smile he
closed his eyes and in a short time the spirit had fled from
his youthful body. The instructions were carried out to
the letter, as were the last wishes of all the dying soldiers
whenever it was possible and practicable. One of the
most important tasks of the Sisters was to write to the
near relatives of the deceased, giving accounts of their
last moments and delivering entrusted messages from the
dying.</p>

<p>On more than one occasion the Sisters supplied the
place of a mother to the wounded and the dying. Many a
pathetic death-bed scene is still fresh in the memory of the
now venerable Sisters who have survived those trying
times. They were able to repress their emotions in most
cases, but there were times when nature asserted itself,
and the tears of compassion flowed freely. This was especially
the case when drummer boys and buglers&mdash;mere
children&mdash;were brought into the hospitals. In such cases
all the tenderness of the Sisters’ gentle natures went out
in abundance to the wounded “lambs,” as they delighted to
call the young ones. One day three blue-eyed, fair-haired
lads in soldier attire were brought into “hospital number
one.” They were ill of typhoid pneumonia and they
were in an advanced stage, too. They were placed on cots
side by side and there they lay for days, uncomplaining
and innocent, giving expression to the quaintest thoughts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
in the most childish way. They were like brothers, although
they were not, and all three were of about the
same height and age. The gratitude they expressed to the
Sisters was more by their manner than anything they
said.</p>

<p>One afternoon one of the three looked up at the Sister
who was nursing him, and with a wistful look in his blue
eyes exclaimed: “Oh, you are such a good lady; just like
my mother to me.” In spite of the care that was lavished
on them the three little heroes died, as so many heroes
have died&mdash;unknown, unhonored and unsung. In the
same room another lad of twelve or thirteen, whose life
was fast ebbing away, cried out: “Oh, Sister, put your
head right down by me and don’t leave me.” The request
was complied with, and the little fellow clasped the Sister
about the neck and never let go his hold until grim death
relaxed it soon afterward. Who could look on such scenes
unmoved! Many boys died thus. Death seemed to pluck
the choicest and freshest of the earth to make its bouquets
during those four fearful years. The Sisters’ care of
their “lambs” after their death was as tender and reverential
as it had been in life. Their eyes were closed with a
prayer, their silken locks parted and their little hands
folded as if in supplication to the Divine mercy. Who can
doubt but what the blessings of heaven were showered
upon these innocent, heroic souls?</p>

<p>The Sisters were “always on duty,” and sometimes the
duty was more severe than at others. After great battles,
such as Shiloh, the hospitals were hardly able to accommodate
the hundreds that were brought there. When the
orderlies had performed the first essential service for the
newcomer he would be taken in charge by the Sisters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
Refreshing draughts and nourishing food were intermingled
with the remedies that would be administered
from time to time. The ladies of Louisville were frequent
visitors at the hospitals, and they brought many delicacies
for the sick and the wounded. At length near the close of
the war the Sisters were recalled to their home from the
Louisville hospitals. The recall came none too soon for
the survivors, as they stood much in need of rest and
change of air. For nearly three years they had been confined
in the close wards of the three hospitals, and this not
unnaturally had its effect upon their health. Many of
them overestimated their strength and their powers of endurance.
Some died in the hospitals, others soon after, at
a premature age.</p>

<p>The actual number of Catholic Sisters who laid down
their lives during the civil war, that their fellow-creatures
might live, will probably never be known, but there is no
question that hundreds did so. Their names are not cut
upon any earthly monuments, but they are surely emblazoned
in letters of gold in the great book of the Recording
Angel. The Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, as Mother
Carroll could have testified, furnished their full quota of
fair martyrs. Many instances have been lost in the long
number of years that have elapsed since the closing of the
war, but several well-authenticated cases still linger
freshly in the minds of those that were witnesses of the
great struggle. One of these is particularly pathetic.
Sister Mary Lucy, one of the sweetest young members of
the Order, richly endowed by nature, was one of the
teachers in St. Mary’s Academy, at Paducah. When the
exigencies of war compelled the temporary abandonment
of this institution, Sister Mary Lucy volunteered as one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
of the hospital nurses. She was assigned to some of the
severest typhoid cases, and the manner in which she
nursed these patients won for her the unqualified praise of
the hospital doctors and attendants.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_189" src="images/i_189.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OBSEQUIES OF SISTER MARY LUCY.</p></div>

<p>The post of honor in this instance proved to be the
post of danger. Sister Mary Lucy contracted the fever
from one of her patients who was convalescent. This was
in the latter part of December, during the first year of the
war. Despite the best medical attention she rapidly grew
worse, until December 29, when she expired as calmly and
heroically as she had lived. Her death cast a gloom over
the entire hospital, and the soldiers of both armies were
filled with admiration and awe at the martyrdom of this
gentle soul. They determined that she should be honored
in death as she had been in life, and that her final obsequies
should be of a character befitting her great merits.</p>

<p>Several files of soldiers marched with muffled drums
and noiseless tread from the Central Hospital to the Ohio
River, bearing in the midst of them the remains. There
the coffin was placed in a gunboat in waiting, which had
been especially designated for this service. Then the boat
slowly steamed away, bearing its honored burden under a
flag of truce to Uniontown, Ky. On landing, the remains
were borne to St. Vincent’s Academy, some miles distant,
where the Sisters own a considerable tract of land and
where they have a last resting place for their dead. Father
Powers, at that time pastor of the Catholic Church at
Paducah, said the Solemn Mass of Requiem and accompanied
the body to the grave and recited over it the last
offices of the Church, of which the deceased had been such
an exemplary member. A guard of devoted soldiers
watched by the coffin day and night from the time it left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
the Central Hospital until the earth covered it from mortal
view. At night the tender-hearted warriors kept their
vigil around the coffin with blazing torches made of pine
knots. Sister Mary Lucy was born in the vicinity of the
spot where she was buried. She received her education at
St. Vincent’s Academy, became a Daughter of Charity and
died in the performance of her duty. This is the short but
brilliant life history of one heroic woman.</p>

<p>A letter dated Louisville, February 1, 1862, written by
one of the army surgeons to Mother Francis Gardner, contained
the following announcement: “I regret very much
to have to inform you of the death of Sister Catherine at
the General Hospital in this city. She, as well as the
other Sisters at the hospital, has been untiring and most
efficient in nursing the sick soldiers. The military authorities
are under the greatest obligations to the Sisters
of your Order.”</p>

<p>Still another conspicuous loss was soon to be felt in
the death of Sister Appollonia, the directress of “No. 1
Hospital.” She served long and faithfully in this post and
won warm commendation from stern soldiers, who, whatever
else their faults, were never guilty of flattery. She
was a woman of great executive ability, and was instrumental
in causing order to come out of chaos in the hospital
over which she presided. Her zeal was great. Not
content to direct affairs, she also nursed individual cases.
It was while engaged in this work that she contracted
typhoid fever, from which she soon after died. She had
endeared herself to the soldiers by her kind and motherly
treatment of them, and her death caused universal regret.</p>

<p>The manner in which the Sisters were treated by the
soldiers had in it a blending of the humorous and the sublime.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
Those of the Sisters that live to tell the tale say
that nothing was wanting in the courtesy with which they
were invariably considered by the men of both armies. On
Sundays they were given especial consideration.
They were escorted to Mass by a military guard of honor,
and received the military salute in passing to and
fro in the neighborhood of the hospital and the camps.
Some of the invalid soldiers imagined that every Sister
carried a charm about her, and was thus protected from
the contagious diseases that caused such sad havoc among
the men. But the supposed charms were not always successful
in preventing the Sisters from wearing the
martyr’s crown in death. The only charms they carried,
as the soldiers soon discovered, were blameless lives, absolute
devotion to duty and entire self-forgetfulness.</p>

<p>There was one modest institution near the three large
hospitals in Louisville where a great amount of good was
done in an unostentatious manner. This was St. Joseph’s
Infirmary, conducted by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth.
This was generally filled in war times with wounded
officers and other invalids connected with both armies.
The good done there, though not quite as conspicuous as
elsewhere, was lasting, and bore fruit in after years.

<p>Bardstown, three miles distant from Nazareth
Academy, in Nelson County, Ky., was occupied successively
by the Union and the Confederate armies. Some
hostile engagements had taken
place in the vicinity of the
town and in the neighboring
counties, and as a result the
place was kept in a state of
feverish anxiety. The victories
and the defeats were attended
with the usual result, killed and wounded men and
sickness and suffering on all sides. Here again the peaceful
aid of the Sisters came at an opportune time. Fully
aware of the great need there was for experienced nurses,
the Mother in charge of Nazareth sent a devoted band of
Sisters to the Baptist Female College in Bardstown, which
had been temporarily fitted up for hospital uses. On their
arrival they found that they had to care for a large number
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
of disabled Confederate soldiers. They quickly began
their humane work and carried it to a successful completion.
The Confederates were on the march, and their
wounds had to be bound up quickly or not at all. When
they had withdrawn from the town, taking with them
their convalescents, the Union forces came in. Their
sick and wounded were also nursed by another band of
the same Sisters at St. Joseph’s College, which was conducted
by the Jesuit fathers, but which, of course, at that
time was not in educational use. Thus in the midst of
civil strife, with the bullets flying thick and fast, did the
Sisters work under one flag&mdash;a flag that was respected by
Northerner and Southerner alike&mdash;the flag of humanity.</p>

<p>Some of the episodes connected with the work of the
Sisters was of an exciting and dramatic nature. Late one
night in September, 1862, twelve Confederate soldiers in
their gloomy gray uniforms marched into Nazareth, after
a wearisome journey from Lexington, Ky. They were
received, as all visitors are, with kindness and hospitality.
They came to ask the Sisters to nurse their sick and
wounded comrades. The request was granted at once.</p>

<p>“How many Sisters can you spare for the work?”</p>

<p>“Six now and more later, if necessary,” was the
prompt reply.</p>

<p>“When will they be ready to return with us?”</p>

<p>“This very night, and at once,” was the incisive reply.</p>

<p>Such promptness was as surprising as it was pleasing
to the couriers. That very night six Sisters, without anything
beyond the familiar garb which they wore, their
usual rosaries and a few books of devotion, started on their
mission, ready, if need be, to offer up their lives in what
they believed to be the service of God. They proceeded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
on their long journey under the protection of a flag of
truce. Resting in a farmhouse one night and in Frankfort,
the capital of the State, the next, they finally reached
Lexington in safety. In a few hours they were installed
in one of the large halls in that city, which had been fitted
up for hospital purposes, and without any preliminaries
they began at once to minister to the sufferers who were
collected there. Later in the same year another band of
Sisters of Nazareth nursed the Union soldiers in one of the
colleges in another quarter of the city. As far as can be
ascertained this was Transylvania University.</p>

<p>Events that took place about that time proved that
the Sisters believed no material sacrifices were too great
when made in the cause of suffering humanity. In the
spring of 1862 General Smith, who was then in command
of the Union troops, nearly seven thousand strong, in
Paducah, Southern Kentucky, asked the Nazareth Sisters
to come to the assistance of the many sick and wounded
soldiers scattered about that city. He had been advised
to make the request by Dr. Hewit, who had the general
superintendence of all the hospitals in that section of the
country. Dr. Hewit was a man of great executive ability,
who stood in the very forefront of his profession. He had
great faith in the ability of the Sisters as nurses. He
was a convert to the Catholic Church, and a brother of the
saintly superior of the Paulist Fathers of New York city.
As no communication could be had with the Mother of the
house at Nazareth at this time, owing to the disturbed condition
of affairs, the request caused the Sisters some perplexity.
Only for a time, though. A conclusion was soon
reached. Sister Martha Drury at that time was at the
head of St. Mary’s Academy, probably the leading educational
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
institution in Paducah. She resolved to close the
schools and go with all of her Sisters to the relief of the
soldiers. They went first to the Marine Hospital and then
moved to the Court House, which was known as the Central
Hospital. Their experiences in this place were similar
to those of the Sisters who were engaged in the hospitals
at Louisville.</p>

<p>Their greatest difficulty was experienced in caring
for those soldiers who were afflicted with contagious diseases.
Typhoid and similar fevers held sway in their
most virulent form. The havoc that war had made in the
human frame was painfully evident in this particular hospital.
After the close of the war the Sisters returned to
their academy, which exists in the town to-day in a flourishing
condition. It will ever remain as a monument to
that brave little band of Sisters who gave up their peaceful
pursuits to minister to the afflicted, and it will ever be
pointed out as the house from which Sister Mary Lucy, the
gentle little teacher, went forth to meet her martyrdom
a martyrdom as blessed in the sight of heaven as any ever
undergone by the saints of old.</p>

<p>The gentleness and devotion with which the Sisters
nursed all of the wounded soldiers, no matter what the
color of their uniform and regardless of rank, was not unappreciated
by either “the boys in blue” or “the boys in
gray.” Throughout the whole of the war, with but few
exceptions, their institutions, mother houses and places of
learning were exempt from the usual ravages of internecine
strife. This is especially true of the Sisters of
Charity of Nazareth. Being in close proximity to the contending
armies and their camps, great apprehensions were
felt at one time for the safety of Nazareth. This, too, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
spite of the fact that the daughters and other relatives of
the general officers of both sides were still pupils in the
school. At intervals during the war some of the generals
called at Nazareth for the purpose of visiting their children.
On these occasions they were always hospitably entertained.
Although the Sisters felt comparatively safe,
they desired some official assurance of that fact. As is
usual in such cases, over-timid persons, generally friends
of the pupils, now and then sounded alarms. The following
letter, received by the Mother Superior from General
Wood, the original of which is still in possession of the
Sisters, reassured the community that it need not fear an
intrusion of the military into the sacred precincts. General
Wood was in command of the Union troops:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
“Headquarters U. S. Forces,<br />
“Bardstown, Ky., January 20, 1862.<br />
</p>

<p>“To the Lady Superior and Sisters of the Convent of
Nazareth: I have just had the pleasure to receive by the
hands of your messenger the very polite and complimentary
note of the Right Rev. Bishop Spalding, and I hasten
to apprise you that it is my earnest desire and intention
to afford you perfect protection and the enjoyment of all
your rights both as an institution and as ladies individually.
It is my earnest wish and intention to secure you
and your ancient institution (which has educated so many
of the fair daughters of my own native State, Kentucky),
from all molestation and intrusion, and to this end I pray
you will not hesitate to make known to me any grievances
you may have on account of any misconduct on the part of
any officer or soldier under my command. I assure you
it will be equally my duty and my pleasure to attend to any
request you may have to make. I beg you to dismiss all
apprehensions on account of the presence of the soldiery
in your sacred neighborhood, and to continue your peaceful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
and beneficent vocations as if the clangor of arms did
not resound in our midst.</p>

<p>“I have the honor to be, ladies, your very obedient
servant,</p>

<p class="author">
Th. J. Wood,<br />
“Brigadier General Commanding.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>“Will you do me the favor to send the accompanying
note to Bishop Spalding?”</p>

<p>Later on Nazareth must again have been in dread of
military trespass, for one of its patrons, Hon. James
Guthrie, of Louisville, Secretary of State under a previous
administration, applied to President Lincoln for protection
for the institution. The President graciously issued the
necessary orders, saying that the violation of such orders
by any of the commanders would invoke his serious displeasure.</p>

<p>General Smith, Doctors Hewit, Fry, Kay, Austin and
the officers of the Union army surrounded the Sisters with
every mark of respect and esteem, and they in turn devoted
all their energies to ameliorating the condition of
the suffering soldiers.</p>

<p>In addition to the labors of the Sisters of Charity of
Nazareth already mentioned, they did very effective work
in the neighborhood of Owensboro and Calhoun, Ky. At
the last-named place the sick and wounded soldiers were
quartered in the two Protestant churches of the town.
The Sisters entered these places and attended the sufferers
there with the same diligence and patience that characterized
their work in every other locality. When Sisters
had to be removed on account of their own illness,
their places were promptly supplied by other Sisters. Reinforcements
were on hand to fill every gap in the ranks.
As before mentioned, the Sisters of Nazareth neither required
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
nor received compensation of any sort. The hundreds
of brave souls that have passed away since the war
have no doubt ere this received their reward in a better
world. Dr. Foster, who was engaged in the Louisville hospitals
while the Sisters were there, wrote eulogistic articles
about them in the Louisville papers at that time, but
unfortunately these papers were not preserved.</p>

<p>The famous convent school from which these Sisters
came forth to do their great work is worthy of more than
passing notice. The organization known as the “Sisters
of Charity of Nazareth” was founded by Right Rev.
John B. David, D. D., who was consecrated the first
Bishop of Bardstown (now the Diocese of Louisville) in
1810. Henry Clay, who knew this good man well, pronounced
him “the best representative of royalty off the
throne.” The Bishop, with the Right Rev. B. J. Flaget,
built the little log cabin near Bardstown which was to
be the birthplace of the new order. It was a success
from the start. This was largely due to the piety and
administrative capacity of the mothers in charge. They
were sketched in an article in the “Catholic World” a
few years ago. The first of these was Catherine Spalding,
a member of the eminent Kentucky family of that
name. She held the position of Superior for more than
a quarter of a century, and by her great intellect and
modesty won the affection and admiration of all with
whom she came in contact. On her death, in 1858, she
was attended by another distinguished member of her
family, Right Rev. Martin J. Spalding. After her came
Mother Frances Gardiner, who proved a worthy successor
to a worthy Superior.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>The last of this notable trio was Mother Columba
Carroll, in the world Margaret Carroll. For thirty-five
years she was directress of studies and teacher of the
first and second classes. In 1862, when the Civil War
was beginning to rage fiercely, she was elected Superioress,
and for ten years held that position with credit to
herself and the convent-school.</p>

<p>While Mother Columba took no active part in caring
for wounded soldiers, she was nevertheless the presiding
genius of the establishment at that time, and directed the
movements of the Sisters with extraordinary tact and
good judgment. She held many interviews with persons
in power, and thus warded off petty annoyances and
troubles. The occasion of Mother Columba’s golden jubilee
was celebrated with great fervor by the community on
February 22, 1877. A drama, written by Sister Seraphia,
entitled “Religion’s Tribute to Our Mother on Her Golden
Jubilee,” was performed by the pupils, and was one of the
most successful features of an elaborate programme. One
of the touching incidents of the celebration was a poem
inspired by the venerable Sister Martha, one of the original
five that started at “Old Nazareth,” and addressed to
Mother Columba. Mother Columba was one of the first
pupils under the care of Sister Martha. The following
lines from this graceful offering are worthy of a place
here:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There are many to-day, dear mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who are crowning your head with gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And writing fine things of the record<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your fifty long years have told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, I too, should come with the others,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My offering before you to cast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I am old, and my thoughts, dear mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Somehow will fain run on the past.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
<span class="i0">On the days when our Naz’reth, dear Naz’reth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was not like what Naz’reth is now;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our dear Lord only knew how.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then we spun, and we wove, and we labored<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like men in the fields, and our fare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was scanty enough, and our garments<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were coarse, and our feet often bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we lived like the ravens and sparrows,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the following year Mother Columba’s earthly career
closed, but the force of her example still lives in the hearts
of those who were fortunate enough to be her pupils and
associates. Mothers Catherine, Frances and Columba made
a truly wonderful trio. They helped to give Nazareth the
reputation it enjoys to-day, and while the school exists
their memory will endure. The Sisters of Charity of
Nazareth are particularly known in Kentucky, and they
are to be found wherever suffering humanity calls.</p>

<p>The ancient house at Nazareth is the mother from
which have sprung forty-seven branch houses in various
parts of the country&mdash;schools, orphan asylums and hospitals.
Perhaps the most conspicuous of the latter is the
“Mary and Elizabeth Hospital,” in Louisville, founded by
William Shakespeare Caldwell as a memorial to his wife
and a tribute to the Sisters who educated her. The
mother house is located a few miles south of Bardstown,
which is forty miles from Louisville. The buildings are
extensive and imposing. There is a presbytery, a convent
and academy, a chapel and the commencement hall. In
the old-fashioned hall are full-length portraits of Bishops
Flaget and David and Father Chambige. The library
contains five thousand volumes, and in the corner is an excellent
bust of the late Archbishop Spalding. Mother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Helena is the present Superior, and in the administration
of her office she has clung to the best traditions of the past.</p>

<p>I am sure I will be pardoned for digressing sufficiently
from the main subject of this volume to mention a few of
the distinguished patrons and graduates of this institution.
The patrons included Henry Clay, who sent his
daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter there;
Judge Benjamin Winchester, John J. Crittenden, Judge
John Rowan, Zachary Taylor, Jefferson Davis, James
Guthrie, George D. Prentice and Charles Wickliffe. The
graduates include Sarah Knox Taylor, daughter of President
Zachary Taylor; Madame Henrietta Spalding, now
Superior of the Sacred Heart Convent, in Chicago; the
first wife of Jefferson Davis; Mary Eliza, daughter of
James Breckinridge, of Kentucky; Mary Gwendoline Caldwell,
the original benefactress of the Washington University;
the wife of United States Senator Vance, of North
Carolina; the four nieces of Jefferson Davis, all converts;
Mary Anderson, whose professional career is as much a
matter of pride to the good Sisters as her private virtues,
and Miss Taney, the author of the State poem, “The
Pioneer Women of Kentucky,” written for the World’s
Fair. Such is the institution that furnished so many
nurses for the camps and the hospitals.

<p>The work done by the Sisters of Charity of Mount
St. Vincent during the war was of a high order. The first
of the Sisters to enter the service as nurses were Sisters
Anthony and Sophia. Both
were sent to Camp Dennison,
Cincinnati, O., on the 1st of
May, 1861. On the evening
before that date a peculiar
holy calm was upon the beautiful
convent, which is located
on a hill top, just within the limits of Cincinnati. The
structure, surrounded by cedar trees and well-cultivated
grounds, had in it the appearance of nobility, religion,
peace and charity. The golden rays of the setting sun
glanced, then darkened as the Sisters were enjoying their
evening walk. A messenger suddenly called for the
Superior. The Mother leaves her religious family to attend
to business. Only a few minutes elapse when she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
returns to inform her Sisters that his honor, the Mayor of
Cincinnati, and the Most Rev. Archbishop Purcell earnestly
request the Sisters of Charity to attend the sick
troops who are stationed at Camp Dennison. There were
no commands; all willingly volunteered to nurse the sick
soldiers. Preparations were quickly made, and on May
1, 1861, five members of the community were named for
the camp. Sisters Sophia and Anthony were sent in advance,
and Sisters Bernardine, Alphonse and Magdalen
followed. Camp Dennison was situated about fifteen
miles from Cincinnati, on the Little Miami Railroad. This
location was advantageous for many reasons&mdash;easy of access,
with ample space and abundance of water, level and
suitable for military purposes. Mother Josephine, the
presiding Superior, accompanied the Sisters to this new
home. Their duties consisted principally in attending
the soldiers who were suffering from measles, which had
broken out in the ranks in the very worst form. After
these soldiers had recovered health the Sisters returned to
the Mother Superior House at Cedar Grove, Cincinnati.</p>

<p>After the return from Camp Dennison a hasty call
was received from the Mayor of Cumberland to attend
the sick and wounded of that place. Sister Anthony
was among the number, and an amusing incident is related
of the Sisters’ leave-taking. As the good-byes were
being said the train moved off, carrying only Sister
Anthony. She arrived in Columbus some hours in advance
of the others, who boarded the next train. Arriving
at the station in Columbus she received a telegram
from the Most Rev. Archbishop of Cincinnati to return immediately
to St. John’s Hospital to prepare for the sick
and wounded soldiers who were there, being brought from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
different places. The Sisters named for Cumberland were
Sisters Sophia, Ambrosia, Ettiene, Agnes, Jane, Mary,
Gabriella. There they were kindly received by a Catholic
family. Dr. McMahon, the attending physician, was kind
and attentive.</p>

<p>The weather was cold, the accommodations poor and
the hospitals, of which there were twelve, were some distance
from each other. There were crowded into these
hospitals at one time 2200 poor soldiers, suffering from
typhoid fever, pneumonia, erysipelas, etc. The duties
were very trying, but a murmur never escaped from the
lips of one Sister of Charity. Almighty God and His glory
being their only aim, all seemed easy. “Sad and numerous
were the scenes we witnessed in those hospitals,” says one
of the Sisters, “yet none presents itself more vividly to my
mind to-day than the suffering of the boy soldiers longing
for home and mother. How often were those endearing
words, ‘Mother,’ ‘Home,’ mentioned!”</p>

<p>Sister Jane says: “I had in my ward a droll boy
named Billy. Now, our Billy had watched the Sisters for
some time and addressed me thus: ‘Lady, what is that I
hear the boys call you? Sister! Ah, that is a beautiful
name. Well, Sister, will you give me your Bible? I
would like to know something of your religion.” Billy
received the little Bible, or rather a small catechism, of
which he made good use. He was soon baptized, made his
first holy communion, and his zeal did not end here. “Often
have I seen him on a platform explaining the words of his
catechism to his comrades, many of whom became fervent
children of the Church. Many hundreds of like instances
could be cited, but I trust they are written in the Book
of Life.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<p>Sister Agnes spent about three months in Cumberland
nursing the sick soldiers. She then returned to St.
John’s Hospital, Cincinnati, to nurse the soldiers who were
being sent from Richmond and Nashville to the city. “It
was here I witnessed the most appalling sights,” she says;
“men wanting arms or legs, and sometimes wanting both
arms and legs&mdash;pale, haggard faces, worn from long
marching and fasting. Many, I think, died of broken
hearts. Faces and voices haunt me yet, calling for home
and dear ones whom they were destined never again to
behold on earth. The streets of this now flourishing city
were then the scenes of extreme suffering and misery.
Frequently fine young men, seated on their own coffins,
passed through on their way to execution on some neighboring
hillside.”</p>

<p>About the 16th of February the Sisters received a
hasty call from Cumberland. Mother Josephine and Rev.
Father Collins were to accompany them to the scene of
their duties. They reached Wheeling about 5 P. M. the
next day, and received hospitality from the Visitation
Nuns. The next morning, in the face of a blinding storm
of sleet and snow, the Sisters started for Cumberland,
where they were met at the station by Dr. McMahon, the
surgeon of the post. They walked in procession through
the streets, and were the objects of much curiosity. That
evening they secured some rooms, but slept on the floor.
The next morning they were assigned some apartments in
the house of a Southern gentleman, Dr. Healy, whose sympathy
with the South compelled him to leave home and
family. The accommodations here were little better than
at the hotel. The bunks were made of rough boards, covered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
with straw ticks, and the pillows were of the same
material.</p>

<p>Pages would not suffice to relate all the good done in
Cumberland. Often during the stillness of night one
might have gazed on a Sister as she stood at the cot of a
dying soldier, heard her whisper words of consolation and
religion in his ears, saw her close gently his dying eyes.
Thus they passed long, weary nights.</p>

<p>Early in March, 1863, the Sisters of Mount St. Vincent,
who had already done valiant service in other localities,
were invited to go to Nashville to nurse the sick and
wounded of that place. Those named were Sisters Anthony,
Constantina, Louise, Benedicta and Gabriella.
They left Cincinnati March 19, 1863, and were accompanied
by Rev. Father Tracy. There were four hospitals at
this place, fairly well adapted for their purpose. Sister
Constantina, who took charge of the first one, proved to
be an angel of mercy to the poor invalids. The building
was formerly an old cotton mill, located on an eminence
known as College Hill. The Sisters were quartered in a
small house opposite to this place, and during their stay
were treated with the greatest consideration. Many of
the wounded were sent to this place after the battle of
Stone River. Most of the patients were young, and they
suffered intense agony.</p>

<p>At one time measles became quite epidemic among
the soldiers, from which many of them died. It was during
the mission at this place that General Rosecrans, with
his body-guard, made daily visits to the sick. He was
wont to say in his kind, jovial way: “Come, come, boys,
you are foxing; these Sisters are too good to you,” then
laugh heartily at his remarks. He was very kind to all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
Sisters. The next important call to duty was at New
Creek. The Sisters of Charity named for this colony were
Sister Sophia, in charge, assisted by Sisters Ann, Cecelia,
Beatrice, Stainlaus, Etienne, Laurence and Benedicta.
The chaplain was Rev. Father Corcoran.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_207" src="images/i_207.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BATTLE OF WILSON’S CREEK.</p></div>

<p>From the diary of one of the above-named Sisters the
following is extracted: “We left Cedar Grove Academy
June 9, 1862, for New Creek. Arriving at our destination,
we were assigned a tent, erected for our accommodation
by order of Dr. McMahon. This gentleman, however, soon
procured better quarters for us with a family named
Dinges. Here we performed our duties of nursing the
sick and wounded with energy and zeal. During our stay
at New Creek we were treated with great kindness and
respect, particularly by Colonel Miller, who, although a
Protestant, proved a sincere friend of priest and Sisters.</p>

<p>“It is not surprising that our peculiar dress was a
source of amusement to many persons who had never before
seen a religious. We were frequently asked
why we dressed so differently from other ladies. We are
happy to relate that our care and kindness removed many
prejudices against our religion. We remained at New
Creek about three months; then the army moved to Culpepper
Court House. We followed in ambulances and
nursed the sick soldiers in tents pitched on the camp
grounds. Some of the soldiers had typhoid fever, of which
disease many of them died. When the Confederates were
victorious at Harper’s Ferry we retreated to Washington,
whence we returned to the Mother house, Cincinnati.”</p>

<p>Gallipolis was the next assignment. The Sisters
named for the field of charity were Sisters Louis, Ambrosia,
Euphrasia, Basilia, Gonzaga, Laurence, Constantina
and Seraphine. About eight months after their return
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
from Cumberland they were ordered to this location
to attend the soldiers from Winchester and Lynchburg.
The wounded did not reach the hospitals until fourteen
days after the battle. The misery and suffering presented
was most frightful. The attending physician was Dr.
Stone, and the chaplain was Rev. Father Callenberg. Sister
Gonzaga, a very holy person, who has since gone to
her reward, took quite an interest in little Toby, a little
darky, who was conspicuous about the camp, and who endeavored,
whenever an opportunity occurred, of instructing
him in the knowledge and love of God. When she
thought she had instructed him sufficiently and an examination
would not be out of place, she called him to her and
said: “Toby, who made you?”</p>

<p>“Dun no, Sister,” he answered.</p>

<p>She then said to him: “Well, Toby, who made the
trees, the grass, the flowers and all these beautiful things
which we see around us?”</p>

<p>The little fellow looked at her for awhile and said:
“Dun no; dey was all hyar when I comed.”</p>

<p>The soldiers in Gallipolis acted as gentlemen in their
intercourse with the Sisters. The sight of a Sister was
sufficient to check the least levity. Men who had been
taught to look on Catholics as dangerous people learned
to love and respect the faith which taught even women
to sacrifice their lives for the comfort or relief of the soldiers.</p>

<p>The Governor of Indiana made application to the
Most Rev. Archbishop of Cincinnati for the Sisters to care
for and nurse his troops in Richmond, Ky. Sisters Anthony
and Sophia were among the first ones sent. They
traveled in ambulances from Cincinnati. The following
are extracts from the diaries of these religious:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>“Much, very much, might be said of our work at Richmond,
but God alone could tell the story. En route from
here (Cincinnati) we witnessed sights the most appalling;
the grounds were covered with wounded, dying and dead
bodies. Some of the dead bodies were only partially covered,
hands and feet protruding. The weather being very
hot added not a little to the hardships of this scene of action.</p>

<p>“Arriving in Richmond, we began work immediately.
The hospital had been an academy, affording wards larger
and better than many other locations during the war.
Shortly after attending to those suffering from the most
severe wounds, a Sister discovered a poor soldier crouched
in a corner. For hours he had lain under the burning rays
of the sun, suffering severely from a wound received in his
shoulder. The flesh surrounding the wound was dreadfully
mangled, and owing to neglect was swarming with
vermin. Pale and haggard he looked. I shall never forget
him. We washed and dressed his wounds and administered
the necessary cordials, and when we placed him in a
clean cot the reader may imagine his joy.</p>

<p>“Another ward in this hospital accommodated more
than one hundred men. Seventeen were lying on the
floor, each of whom had lost one or more limbs. ‘What
shall we do with these poor men?’ was the constant query.</p>

<p>“The first death that occurred was of a man who had
been shot through the lung. He had been exposed to the
heat of the sun, and had eaten no food for hours. Everything
was done for him, but his moments on earth were
few. He received the last sacraments and died a beautiful
death. His last words were: ‘Thanks to the Sisters.’
This death and its attending circumstances were the cause
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
of many conversions. One pious Episcopalian asked the
Sisters for books on the subject of religion, saying that ‘a
religion which teaches gentle ladies such devoted self-sacrifice
for suffering humanity must be Divine.’</p>

<p>“No page in history can record such noble deeds of courage
and devotion as that illuminating the life and labors
of these Sisters during their stay at Richmond. Particularly
noble was our much esteemed Sister Anthony.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>“History can point to annals of devotion and self-sacrifice
of noble women, but no annals are so rich in noble
work and silent charity as that of our loved Sister. Hundreds
of men scattered over the States will always remember
and revere her. She seemed happy when engaged
in alleviating the sufferings of others, particularly of the
soldiers.”</p>

<p>The following anecdote from the diary of a Sister illustrates
the influence that the religious possessed with these
soldier boys:</p>

<p>“It is midnight. The moon sends her welcome light to
cheer my watching hours. There is stillness all around,
although many soldiers are suffering. But listen! I hear
moans. A poor soldier is dying; must away to his cot. Yes,
he was dying. I prayed, then spoke: ‘Now, my young
friend, you are going home.’ ‘Home!’ said the boy; ‘what
do you mean, Sister?’ ‘Why, would you not like to go to
heaven?’ ‘Sister, are you going there when you die?’ I assured
the boy that I sincerely hoped to go there. ‘Well,’
said he, ‘so do I.’ I called the chaplain, had the soldier
baptized and ere the morning dawned this beautiful soul
was in heaven.”

<p>None of the Sisters who gave up their time and talents
to the cause of suffering humanity did better work than
the Sisters of Mercy. Their most conspicuous service was
on Southern battlefields, although,
like their colleagues in
this merciful work, they were
subject to the call of duty no
matter whence it came. On
the 19th of June, 1862, Vicar
General Starrs, of New York,
applied for a sufficient corps of nurses to take charge of
a military hospital in North Carolina. The proposition
was laid before the Sisters of St. Catherine’s Convent of
Mercy, in New York City, and the invitation promptly and
cheerfully accepted.</p>

<p>Nine Sisters were selected for the mission. They included
Sisters Mary Augustine MacKenna, M. Elizabeth
Callanan, M. Paul Lennon, M. Gertrude Ledwith, M. Paula
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
Harris, M. Veronica Dimond and M. Agatha MacCarthy.
The Mother Superior and Mother Alphonsus decided to go
with the party. The chaplain was Rev. Father Bruhl, a
native of Hungary, sixty years of age. He had a long,
flowing grey beard, and while he was not possessed of an
adequate knowledge of English, he was equipped with a
valuable experience of hospital work incident to warfare.
This was derived from long and laborious service in the
French army during the war which resulted in the taking
of Algiers.</p>

<p>The Sisters bade adieu to their convent friends on the
15th of July, and boarded the Government boat Catawaba,
which was to take them to the scene of their future labors
at Beaufort, N. C. The Sisters were under the care of
General Foster, who showed them every consideration.</p>

<p>It happened that 500 horses, destined for cavalry service,
were to be passengers on the vessel, and as the
tedious and somewhat distressing process of getting them
into the hold only commenced after the Sisters boarded
the boat the Catawaba could not leave the dock until the
afternoon of July 16.</p>

<p>A non-Catholic officer writing from Beaufort at this
time says:</p>

<p>“The Hammond General Hospital, at Beaufort, N. C.,
is eligibly located on the bay, the tide rising and falling
entirely around the main building. It is under the care
of the Sisters of Mercy, whose earnest devotedness to the
noble task they have assumed is manifested in the cleanly
condition of the place and the comfort and contentment
displayed by all the patients. One kitchen, a perfect
‘bijou’ of a kitchen, is devoted to the use of the Sisters,
where they prepare every kind of delicacy which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
condition of the sick require, in such a manner as those
good Sisters only can prepare such things. The prejudice
which exists in some illiberal-minded persons toward
Catholics would be very speedily and effectually dispelled
could they witness, as we have, these worthy
ladies modestly but earnestly pursuing their vocation
among the sick and wounded, with no hope of reward
until He, whose divine example they imitate, shall say:
‘I was weary and ye ministered unto me.’ Long may
Sister Mary Madeline, the Superior, and her amiable
Sisters be spared to pursue their work of faith and love
among us. Our soldiers feel truly grateful to Mrs. Foster,
the accomplished wife of our Major General, for her consideration
in bringing the Sisters here.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_212" src="images/i_212.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SISTERS OF SATTERLEE HOSPITAL.</p></div>

<p>The structure which was known as the “hospital” is
thus admirably described by Mother Mary Carroll: “It
was a large building that had formerly been a summer
hotel. It was so near the shore that at high tide the
waves rolled in and out under the timber props on which
it was erected. It was a frame building, containing 500
rooms. The Sisters arrived in the midst of a heavy rain
storm. As they passed from the wharf to the building, in
single file, all dressed in black, the patients, looking out of
the windows, took them for nine lone widows, seeking the
dead bodies of their husbands!</p>

<p>“The place contained no furniture except a few miserable
bedsteads, and was in a most desolate condition.
There was only one broom and very few utensils. The
broom, in possession of Chloe, a saucy little negress, was
seldom available. Along the shore were wrecks of pianos,
tables, chairs, glass, etc. There were no candles or lamps,
and every one was compelled to retire before night.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>Truly, a forsaken habitation for women, the most of
whom had been brought up in homes of comfort and refinement.
The house was extremely dirty, and the Sisters got
very little rest the first night. The next day a transformation
took place. The new-comers, with what assistance
they could obtain from the natives, began the work of
housecleaning. “Bob” Sproul, a young negro, who was
presented with a red shirt, was installed as water carrier.
He was so delighted with the conspicuous but useful garment
that he wore it outside of his Sunday coat and proclaimed
himself “the best-dressed man in North Carolina.”</p>

<p>The first dinner of the Sisters was a “sumptuous repast”
of pork and beans and mouldy bread, to which was
added coffee sweetened with molasses. Eight rooms were
assigned to the nurses. These rooms were
located on the second story, and opened out on a piazza
overlooking the sound. In spite of the great consideration
shown the Sisters, they were compelled to undergo
many privations. Two of the Sisters, whose names are
not recorded, died from the effects of these hardships, and
several were dangerously ill.</p>

<p>Nearly all the patients differed from the Sisters in religious
belief, and their coming caused several humorous
as well as pathetic incidents. Many of the soldiers had
never met “a real, live” Sister before. Their minds had
been installed with false notions, and it was some days
before they appreciated the Sisters in their real character
and at their true worth. After the work in the locality
was finished, the steward of the hospital confessed that he
often sat up until 1 o’clock in the morning watching the
Sisters, fully expecting them to poison the patients, or do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
some other terrible thing, they being “confessed emissaries
of the Pope.”</p>

<p>The dress of the Sisters scared some of the others.
“Great heavens!” shrieked one patient to the nurse that
bent over him, “are you a man or a woman? But your
hand is a woman’s hand; its touch is soft, and your voice
is gentle. What are you?”</p>

<p>“Only a poor servant of the Great Master, come from
afar to serve you,” said the Sister.</p>

<p>“Sister,” moaned another, “I’m dying. I want to be
what you are; help me.”</p>

<p>“What the Sister believes, I believe,” cried another,
who had probably never known any religion. “Sister, tell
me what to answer when the priest comes to baptize me.”</p>

<p>When the patients finally recovered sufficiently to
leave the hospital they would offer little keepsakes to the
Sisters&mdash;a button, a shred of blue or gray, a pebble&mdash;with
a fervent “God bless you, Sister. I’ll never forget you.
Pray for me.”</p>

<p>The Sisters became part of the patients’ lives. They
did more than nurse them. They cheered them in their
hours of despondency, and wrote letters for them to the
anxious ones at home. Some of the Sisters, by reason of
ill health, were compelled to return to New York. Their
places were promptly filled with recruits from the Mother
House.</p>

<p>The perfect discipline among the Sisters, the spirit of
humility and self-sacrifice that prevailed generally, was
exhibited when the Mother Superior in charge was succeeded
by Mother M. Augustine McKenna. Mother Augustine
was one of the women who had previously prepared
food for the soldiers. The patients and others were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
surprised to learn, after the change, that she was not only
a person of great executive ability, but that she was also
a woman of the utmost refinement, and one of the most
intellectual members of the Sisterhood.</p>

<p>In October, 1862, it was found that Beaufort was too
much exposed for the patients, and they were removed to
Newberne. The residence of Governor Stanley was placed
at the disposal of the Sisters. It was transformed into a
handsome convent, the parlor being used as a chapel.
After the raids at Goldsboro all of the wards were crowded
with sick and wounded. Americans, Germans, Irish and
Creoles, all came in the same ambulances, with their
clothing matted to the skin from ghastly wounds. They
were all treated alike by the nurses, who were working
in the cause of humanity.</p>

<p>Some time after the war Jefferson Davis, ex-President
of the late Confederacy, addressing a number of the Sisters,
said: “Will you allow me, ladies, to speak a moment
with you? I am proud to see you once more. I can
never forget your kindness to the sick and wounded in our
darkest days, and I know not how to testify my gratitude
and respect for every member of your noble order.”</p>

<p>Mr. Davis met Mother Mary Teresa Austen Carroll in
1887, and he reiterated his expressions of thankfulness
toward the sisters who had performed what he called a
great work. Many other dignitaries and soldiers on both
the Union and Confederate sides testified to the good services
rendered by the Sisters of Mercy. Their labors, however,
did not end with the war, for after that cruel period
they busied themselves in establishing homes for widows
and asylums for the orphans.</p>

<p>The Sisters of Mercy also worked with unremitting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
zeal during the war at Mississippi Springs, Oxford, Jackson
and Shelby Springs. The Southern Sisters, after devoting
months to the service of the sick and wounded
soldiers in these localities, returned home to Vicksburg
only to find that General Slocum had confiscated their
convent for a headquarters. Father Michael O’Connor,
S. J., formerly Bishop of Pittsburg, was a personal friend
of Secretary of the War Stanton, and he at once interested
himself in the cause of the Sisters. After a brief
correspondence their property was restored to them.</p>

<p>In February, 1862, the Mayor of Cincinnati applied to
the Archbishop of the same city for a sufficient number
of Sisters to nurse the sick and wounded soldiers of the
Ohio regiments. The application was sent to Mother Teresa,
who not only complied with it, but headed the delegation
of Sisters that went to the front. Grant and Johnson
had met at Shiloh and the battle of Pittsburg Landing
was the result. The Sisters went down the river on the
Superior, preparing bandages and other hospital necessaries
on the way.</p>

<p>There was plenty of work to do when they landed,
and it was entered upon with zeal. A number of secular
ladies also arrived upon the scene and insisted upon
aiding in the work. The Sisters cheerfully accepted their
assistance. In a few days small-pox broke out among the
patients and the secular ladies suddenly remembered that
they had important engagements elsewhere. They deserted
the temporary hospitals with more haste than dignity,
leaving the Sisters in undisputed possession. Mother
Teresa was especially devoted during the small-pox epidemic,
joining the other Sisters in personally dressing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
wounds of the patients suffering from this loathsome disease.</p>

<p>The Sisters of Mercy also worked zealously in St. Louis.
They visited almost daily the hospitals on the Fair
Grounds in that city, where an average of from 1000 to
2000 sick and wounded men were being cared for. Many
other visitations were made to private hospitals and private
dwellings, where the necessities of the occasion happened
to place the disabled soldiers. Particular attention
was paid to the patients in the McDowell College, used as
a hospital for sick prisoners of war. The Sisters sent large
hampers to this institution filled with clothing and with
delicacies in the way of food and drink.</p>

<p>Some of the poor sufferers were stone-blind, but as soon
as they discovered that the Sisters of Mercy were among
them they would stretch out their hands, crying, “Welcome,
Sisters. If you had never given us anything we
would still rejoice to have you come amongst us with your
consoling words.”</p>

<p>Three of the prisoners of war in the McDowell Hospital
were condemned to be shot as a measure of “retaliation”&mdash;one
of the cruel customs of the war. The sentence
of death had been passed with all due military solemnity,
and the carrying out thereof was inevitable. Knowing this
to be the case the Sisters visited the condemned men
in their cells and urged them to make suitable preparations
for death. The unfortunate men received the Sisters
with cordiality, but they were furious at the decree
which condemned them to death, and absolutely refused
to consider any suggestions which would cause them to
forgive their enemies. While the Sisters were pleading
with the men an armed guard stood at the door and two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
other sentinels paced up and down the corridor with a
regularity and grimness that filled the scene with awe.</p>

<p>Finally perseverance conquered. The doomed men
relented, and a clergyman accompanied them to the scaffold.
They were blindfolded when making fervent acts
of contrition, and while engaged in this pious devotion
were launched into eternity.</p>

<p>One of the duties that devolved upon the Sisters during
the war, as well as thereafter, was the care of the
widows and orphans of the soldiers. There was one pathetic
case in the McDowell Institution. It concerned two
little girls, daughters of Southern prisoners. Their mother
and married sister had died in the prison, and their father
was among the missing. The little ones were seriously
ill when they were brought to the attention of the Sisters.
They were in such a sad plight that their clothes
had to be changed in the yard, and the cast-off garments
buried. Baptism was administered to them, and their
physical needs given immediate attention. The younger
child, about 8 years of age, died a few days later. The
other recovered and was instructed in the ways necessary
for a life of virtue and usefulness. At the close
of the war she was claimed by her father. He had searched
the city in a vain endeavor to find his offspring, and
when he had all but abandoned hope located her in the
“House of Mercy,” conducted by the Sisters. On being
given positive pledges that the child would be properly
cared for the Sisters restored her to the anxious father.</p>

<p>Mary Mulholland, who became known as Mother
Francis of the Sisters of Mercy, did wonderfully effective
work during the war. She was born in Armagh, Ireland,
in 1808, but came to this country when a mere child.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
Her one desire was to become a member of one of those
devoted Sisterhoods that give their lives to the service
of the Creator. In spite of the opposition of her parents
this object was finally achieved. The opportunity came
when Bishop Quarter engaged a colony of Sisters of
Mercy for Chicago in 1843. The journey to the Western
city was by stage and boat. A terrific storm arose while
the party was crossing Lake Michigan. A high wave
swept over the deck of the vessel, carrying men, women
and children into the angry waters.</p>

<p>Mary Mulholland was one of those that went overboard,
and when a brave man&mdash;a Mr. Ogden, who afterwards
became the first Mayor of Chicago&mdash;attempted to
save her she cried: “Leave me to my fate; save the
others.” He did save others, but he saved her, too, for
a future of usefulness and good works. The future
Mother of the Order received the white veil from the
Bishop in April, 1847, and was professed by dispensation
December 28, 1848. Her business accomplishments made
her a valuable member of the community.</p>

<p>Speaking of the experience of this good woman in
the Civil War Mother Carroll says<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>: When the Civil
War broke out Mother Frances organized among the
Sisters a band of volunteer nurses to minister to the
sick and wounded on Southern battlefields. She accompanied
them to Missouri, and set them to work. In Chicago
she looked after the soldiers, whether sick or prisoners.
A Sister who shared with her the fatigues of
these great works writes: “Many soldiers crying out in
agony on their hard beds blessed her as she passed her
holy hands over their burning brows. The absent fathers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
and mothers for whom they called could not come,
but this gentle, humble, self-sacrificing soul supplied
their places. A Southern lad of 18 cried like a child
when she laid her hand on his clammy brow. ‘Oh, God,’
he murmured, ‘I thought you were my mother.’ She
prepared him for death, and he died in her arms.</p>

<p>Mother Francis was a power in the prisons and hospitals
when the most influential gentlemen and committees
were refused admission. There were so many sympathizers
with Confederates in Chicago that a general
uprising between Federals and Secessionists was often
feared. Whenever or wherever the Sisters of Mercy
appeared the sick and wounded soldiers, whether in blue
or gray uniform, were abundantly supplied with everything
necessary for their comfort. Once when Secretary
Stanton refused to supply more rations during the current
month the case was laid before the President, who
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To all whom it may concern:&mdash;On application of the
Sisters of Mercy in Chicago of the Military Hospital in
Washington furnish such provisions as they desire to
purchase and charge the same to the War Department.</p>

<p class="author">
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>After the war Mother Frances continued her useful
work in many convents of her order, dying peacefully
on December 8, 1888.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>

<p class="hang">Solicitude of the Sisters for the patients under their care. Friendships
formed that were only parted by death. Interesting reminiscences of
Mother M. Augustine MacKenna concerning the Government Hospital
at Beaufort, N. C. A victim of camp fever and how he was relieved by
the nurse.</p>

<div id="i_222" class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_222.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>There were many incidents of interest in the hospitals
at Beaufort and Newberne, N. C., told by Mother M. Augustine
MacKenna to her niece, Sister Dolores, and other
members of the community of
the Sisters of Mercy. Some of
these were incorporated in a
neat little book called the
“Milestone,” issued last year
to commemorate the golden
jubilee or 50th anniversary
of the Sisters of Mercy in
New York City. The principal
points are embodied in the paragraphs that follow.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>Beaufort is a village on a little peninsula that runs
out into Bogue Sound. It is directly opposite to Fort
Macon, which is built on an island in these shallow waters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
Before the war Beaufort was a place of fashionable
resort for sea bathing, and its principal hotel, though a
frame building, contained five hundred rooms and was
elaborately furnished; but having been sacked in the
spring of 1862 everything of value was destroyed. It was
therefore in a sadly denuded condition when it was utilized
as a hospital and made the temporary resting place of
two hundred disabled men, just two months previous to
the coming of the Sisters.</p>

<p>Only the common army rations had been provided
for these sufferers, and their situation was painful in the
extreme. A complete dearth of utensils in every department
marked the early management of the hospital.
There was no modern means of washing clothes, it had
to be done with a few small, old-fashioned tubs, and the
untrained hands of some escaped field slaves.</p>

<p>No artificial light of any kind, not even a candle,
could be procured at that time in Beaufort, and there
was no proper food or refreshing drink for the patients.
The Sisters sent an urgent requisition to the United
States Sanitary Commission, and very soon the hospital
was amply provided with all necessaries and many comforts
in the line of dressing-gowns, towels, sponges, castile
soap, “Aunt Klyne’s cologne,” etc.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of such suffering many amusing
incidents frequently occurred, as for instance when a
Sister undertook the task of getting the kitchen cleaned.
This establishment had been until now under the control
of a certain functionary called the kitchen steward.
He was a native of Maine, of short, stout build; never
wore shoes (on account of the heat, he said), but always
wore an immense straw hat in the house and out of it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
and constantly sat in a wheelbarrow at the kitchen
door with a huge bunch of keys dangling from the belt of
his ticking apron. He was a woodcutter in his native
forests before he was drafted into the army; he could
neither read nor write, and his name was Kit Condon.
The negroes, and indeed his fellow-soldiers, called him
“Mr. Kit!” It took a great amount of persuasion to induce
“Mr. Kit” to relinquish his keys, the token of his dignified
office, to the “North lady,” as the Sister in charge was
called, and he eyed the cleaning process from his wheelbarrow
with evident disapproval.</p>

<p>“Mr. Trip,” a soldier six feet high, was another
important personage in the culinary department, and this
with “Edward, the baker,” who made his “cookies,” buns,
pies, etc., on the marble top of a ruined billiard table,
completed the kitchen force.</p>

<p>The renovating that kitchen received was marvelous!
Piles of greasy sand were swept into the ocean
through a never-to-be-forgotten hole in the very midst of
the kitchen floor. The house being built on “piles” or
timber supports, this portion of it was directly above
the water. After the debris of a meal had been thrown
them through this opening the fishes could be seen by
hundreds when the tide was in, and nothing could surpass
their voracity, unless indeed it was their quarrelsomeness,
for they seemed bent on annihilating one another.</p>

<p>One day much excitement was created by the arrival
of an escaped slave. A tall young girl was seen running
breathlessly across the sort of bridge or causeway that
connected the hospital premises with the village of Beaufort.
She was quickly followed by an elderly Southerner,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
and he was very close to her when she got to the end of her
perilous race.</p>

<p>The soldiers cheered her wildly, and called to her
that she was safe with them, while they pointed their
bayonets at her pursuer and swore in no measured terms
that they would pitch him into the sea if he laid a finger
on the girl.</p>

<p>However, some of the officers took up the case and
brought both man and girl into the General’s office, in
order to come to an understanding. The man cried out,
“She is my gal; she is my gal; she was born upon my
place; she is mine.” But the General would not listen to
this claim, and told the man the girl was free from the
moment she claimed the protection of the army.</p>

<p>She was all trembling and exhausted with fear, fatigue
and excitement, and during the remainder of that
day she had to be encouraged and consoled and petted
like a baby, although she was 17. Her name was Ellen,
and she had a sweeter face and softer manners than
are generally found among colored persons.</p>

<p>Towards the end of October the tides became very
high, and the water was driven under and around the hospital
with greater impetuosity by the wind. On one occasion
the water was profane enough to invade the
“Hall” where a good old Unitarian minister held forth
to his sparse congregation, and the “meeting” had to be
discontinued. The next tide was still more daring, for
it swept clear through the kitchen and dining room, leaving
in both a debris of dead crabs and little fish, not to
mention seaweed of every variety. All this rendered the
place very uninhabitable, and General Foster, with his
usual thoughtfulness, authorized the Sisters to move to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
Newberne and to take possession of the Stanley House,
the officers and doctors receiving orders at the same time
to remove the patients thither as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The two Sisters sent to inspect the prospects in Newberne
had a delightful sail in an open boat through the
sound, past Fort Macon and past the sea-green islands
on to Moorhead City, which “city” consisted of twelve
houses and a few “shanties.” On arriving at Newberne
the Sisters were agreeably surprised at the aspect of
the “Stanley” House, so-called because it had originally
been the home of Governor Stanley, of North Carolina.</p>

<p>A handsome lawn or courtyard lay in front of the
house. Beautiful large cedars grew within this enclosure,
and as their berries were now ripening flocks of mockingbirds
were rejoicing in their branches and filling the air
with their own inimitable harmony. In a corner stood a
grand old “Pride of India,” the first tree of the kind the
Sisters had ever seen; climbing roses clustered around
the windows, and numbers of little songsters made their
abode in the foliage.</p>

<p>The house was fine and in perfect repair, having been
used as General Burnside’s headquarters. It had not
been ransacked or rifled as most of the other houses had
been. Of the two large handsome parlors one was set
aside for a chapel, and a beautiful one it became soon
afterwards.</p>

<p>In the last week of October the hospital at Beaufort
was vacated, and the sick soldiers were much more comfortably
settled in their winter quarters. The “hospital”
was distinct from the “Stanley residence” and consisted
of three houses and several newly-erected pavilions; a
nice shady path and a large garden separated these
from the Sisters’ domicile.</p>

<p>In December, 1862, General Foster, with a large detachment
of the men under his charge made an attack
on the town of Goldsborough, North Carolina, and almost
ruined it. An immense number of soldiers were wounded,
and, as the doctors’ stores had not arrived, the surgeons
had no old linen or lint with which to bind up the wounds
of the poor sufferers. For this reason they presented a
most fearful spectacle. Some had their heads and faces
wrapped in coarse cloth, and were so besmeared with
blood that the sight was a painful one.</p>

<p>Others, indeed the greater number, had either one
or both feet in a terrible condition, the feet having been
pierced with balls. There were broken legs, broken arms
and one unhappy victim had both hands shot off, and the
condition of these agonizing wounds was something terrible.</p>

<p>The first task of the Sisters was to feed the wretched
sufferers, who had had but little care bestowed upon
them. After that the difficult and distressing duty of
cleansing their wounds was undertaken and was left
entirely to the Sisters.</p>

<p>One very large man named Sherman, an Englishman,
had his mouth and chin so shattered that the doctors
decided that his mouth had better not be touched,
as he must certainly die. However, the Sisters with
soft sponges and warm water began to loosen the horrible
rags with which the poor man’s face and head were covered.
He, poor fellow, had heard enough of the doctor’s
opinion to render him hopeless, and when he found that
efforts were being made to relieve him he tried to evince
his gratitude by signs. When the wraps were removed
blood began to flow from his mouth, and a Sister took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
out with her finger several loosened teeth, and thus
greatly facilitated his breathing. The utmost possible
care was taken of this patient, and the satisfaction of
seeing him perfectly restored to health, though disfigured
in a dreadful manner, was in itself a great reward.
The dumb gratitude he displayed when he came to say
“good-bye” as he was leaving the hospital was very pathetic.</p>

<p>Another interesting case was that of David Brant, a
ruddy-faced lad about 18 years of age. He was suffering
in some way that could not at first be discovered. It
was noticed that he kept moving his feet in a distressing
sort of way. These members were uncovered, when, to
the surprise of the Sister attending him, it was found
that he had still his boots on and that they seemed ready
to burst. Some of the soldiers at hand came with knives
and cut them off, piece by piece, with great difficulty, and
then, alas! it was found that veins of the boy’s legs had
burst open, and his boots were filled with clotted blood.
The doctors were sent for, and had great trouble in
stanching the blood, and in tying up the arteries. It
need hardly be added that the poor lad died the next day
in great agony. He was the victim of a forced march in
which the men were made to run for several miles without
stopping. The Sisters wrote to his father the least
painful account possible of the poor son’s death, and
received a most grateful reply, the bereaved gentleman
adding that but for them he would never have known the
real truth of the sad event.</p>

<p>“Hiram” was a victim of camp-fever; unfortunately
for him he had been kept in camp too long after he took
sick, and the fly-blister had been applied to the back of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
his neck. Some of his comrades took it off, but applied
no dressing of any kind, so that the coarse blue flannel collar
of his shirt grew into the raw sore, and his hair also
festered into it. It was his cries that first attracted the
attention of a Sister, for he was brought into the hospital
in this condition.</p>

<p>She found a soldier trying to relieve him by applying
a coarse wet towel in cold water to his neck, and this
caused the screams of the sufferer. A soft sponge, warm
water and castile soap came into requisition here, and
when the hair was cut so as to free it from the sore,
and the gathers of the shirt loosened from the collar, the
poor boy began to feel a little relief. As he lay with his
face buried in the pillow he did not see who was attending
him.</p>

<p>“Who is doing that?”</p>

<p>“A Sister of Mercy,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“No,” said he, “no one but my mother could do it.”</p>

<p>By degrees the sore was nicely dressed with soft old
linen and cold water&mdash;the only dressing allowed by the
doctors&mdash;and then Hiram stole a glance at his new friend
and nurse.</p>

<p>“What are you, at all?” was the first question.</p>

<p>The Sister tried to make him understand what a Sister
of Mercy does, or tries to do for those who suffer, and
he sank back in his pillow, saying,</p>

<p>“I don’t care what you are; you are a mother to me.”</p>

<p>He was only 16, full of bright intelligence and wit,
but after suffering dreadfully for six weeks from the fatal
fever he died in the arms of his father, who had been apprised
by the Sisters of poor Hiram’s condition, and had
come from Boston to remain with him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>Many such sad incidents might be related, but no
doubt such are the records of every hospital. The Sisters
continued their services until May, 1863, when General
Foster, under whose protection they had been able to effect
much good, was ordered to Tallahassee, Florida,
where there was no need of a military hospital. The necessity
for the Sisters was now not so great in North Carolina&mdash;most
of the poor men having been released from
their sufferings, many by death and others by recovery&mdash;so
preparations were commenced for returning to New
York.</p>

<p>The Sisters felt very much for the poor negro girls
who had attached themselves to them so affectionately,
and who in their simple ignorance thought that the
“North ladies” could do anything and everything. Some
very amusing incidents took place in connection with our
“contrabands.” One night a Sister, having forgotten
something in the kitchen, went for it at a later hour than
usual. All the negro girls and women who worked for
the hospital&mdash;scrubbing, washing, ironing, etc.&mdash;slept in
the rooms over the kitchen; and the Sister, hearing peals
of laughter, did not think it beneath her dignity to act
the part of a listener under these “colored” circumstances.</p>

<p>She therefore went noiselessly up the stairs, and, to
her great amusement, heard herself perfectly imitated by
one of the girls. This Sister had for many months been
giving the general instructions to the women and girls;
now she heard the very tones of her voice and the manner
of her delivery most perfectly reproduced; another
genius undertook to represent another Sister, and so on
until every Sister was portrayed, to the great delight of
the company, the members of which never dreamed of the
amused listener on the kitchen stairs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>The solicitude of the Sisters for the welfare of their
patients frequently caused warm friendships that continued
long after the close of the war. Sister Mary Gertrude
and Mother Mary Augustine were two of the Sisters
attached to the hospitals in Beaufort and Newberne.
One of those cases that came under their care was that
of Charles Edward Hickling, of the Forty-fifth Regiment,
Massachusetts Volunteers. The bravery and manliness of
this young soldier won the hearts of all.</p>

<p>Illness contracted in the service finally caused his
death in 1867. He bore all his suffering with great fortitude.
During his illness the Sisters visited him at his
home, and after his death sent consoling letters to the
bereaved family.</p>

<p>These letters show the tender sympathy and generous
interest of the Sisters towards the soldiers to such an
extent that the writer feels justified in giving brief extracts
from what were intended to be personal missives.</p>

<p>Sister Mary Gertrude, under date of January 3, 1868,
wrote to the parents: “How can I express to you in adequate
terms the very great grief and affectionate sympathy
I feel toward you in your great affliction. May
God be your comfort and your refuge in this trying hour,
for in sufferings such as these no creature can
give you consolation. We must look higher. He who
sent the cross can alone give the power to sustain its
weight. Do not give way to despondency, my very dear
friends. The dear boy has only gone before you for a
time&mdash;we are all hastening towards our turn. In a very
little time we, too, shall have passed the eternal gates,
there to meet all we have loved and lost, and with them
praise the tender mercy of the good God to us whilst in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
our exile. * * * I have been, and am still with you,
in thought and spirit, going through the least detail of
all the trying circumstances of this sad bereavement.”</p>

<p>Mother Augustine, who was the Superior of the Sisters
at the Newberne Hospital, writing to a devoted
friend&mdash;Miss Susan Messinger&mdash;said on January 4, 1868:</p>

<p>“So our brave soldier boy is gone, his long and trying
march has brought him to the goal, and in his young
enthusiasm he has gone to join the numerous band of
those who were his companions on the field and in the
fight, in danger and in privations, exposure and fatigue,
but not in the long years of patient and heroic endurance
which requires more of a martyr’s fortitude than a soldier’s
courage. Dear Charles! He is the last of our soldier
boys&mdash;the last link that bound us to the Boston Regiment,
the brave Massachusetts Volunteers, whose heroism we
shall never forget. * * * Eternity! Dear Charles
knows its wonders now. Let us pray that we may so live,
so use our powers here that our eternity may be with
those who have fought their way through the trials and
sorrows of life to its unending peace.”

<p class="hang">The Sisters of Mercy attend the sick and wounded in the “Irish Brigade,”

<p class="caption">COLONEL MULLIGAN.</p></div>

<p>Soon after the beginning of the war the “Irish Brigade”
was organized in Chicago by Colonel Mulligan,
whose life was sacrificed in the Union cause towards the
close of the war. He was a devout
Catholic, and a warm friend
of the Sisters of Mercy. As his
command were nearly all Catholics
be determined to secure
the services of the Sisters in
behalf of his sick and wounded,
and, before his departure from
Chicago, called on Reverend
Mother Frances, from whom he
obtained the promise that the
suffering among his soldiers should be cared for by her
children. This is the mother of whom a brief sketch is
given in a previous chapter. The regiment left Chicago in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
the summer of 1861, and was finally stationed at Lexington,
Missouri. On September 3, six Sisters of Mercy, escorted
by Reverend Mother Francis and her assistant,
left Chicago under the care of Lieutenant Shanley. The
Superiors were to return when the Sisters were settled
in Lexington.</p>

<p>The hospital was to be in charge of Sister M. Alphonsus
Butler, assisted by her companions. To those who
had never been within sight or sound of “war’s alarms,”
this appeared to be an undertaking of no small hazard.
The Sisters believed they were risking their lives. “Yes,”
said one, “I was fully convinced I should never see Chicago
again.”</p>

<p>They went by St. Louis to Jefferson City, from which
point they were to proceed to Lexington. During their
stay in Jefferson they were the guests of Mr. and Mrs.
Mosely, who were ardent sympathizers with the Southern
cause. Nothing could exceed their attention and kindness
to the Sisters, to whom they showed every mark of respect.
When Mr. and Mrs. Mosely withdrew to St. Louis
they left their beautiful home at the disposal of their
valued guests.</p>

<p>It was rumored that Confederate forces were stationed
along the river banks, and that communication with Lexington
would be speedily cut off. The Sisters, therefore,
embarked on the first boat leaving Jefferson, the “Sioux
City,” which was to carry them to their destination. It
was under command of Lieutenant Shanley, who was
conducting a detachment of troops to Lexington. Several
ladies were on board, among whom was Mrs. Mulligan,
who with her infant daughter was going to join her
husband. As the steamer proceeded up the river the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
rumors of “danger ahead” became more and more alarming.
At length, at the earnest request of some of the
ladies, Lieutenant Shanley gave orders to return to Jefferson.
On reaching that city the officer in command
directed that the ladies who were not willing to undertake
the voyage should be put ashore, and that the “Sioux
City” should resume her voyage to Lexington.</p>

<p>The second attempt, however, proved that the alarm
of the ladies was not unfounded. Danger was constantly
apprehended. It was given out as certain that the
Confederates were stationed at Glasgow, a small town on
the Missouri. When the boat came within a few rods of
it the Confederates were seen rushing from the woods
on both sides of the river. Sister M. Alphonsus, who was
saying her office on deck, saw the men on the right bank
uncovering a cannon and preparing to fire. She hurriedly
entered the state room, saying:</p>

<p>“Here they are!”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked a Sister.</p>

<p>“The Confederates,” she replied.</p>

<p>While they were still speaking they heard the whizzing
and rattling of bullets outside. The head of the
boat was immediately turned, but the firing from both
sides of the river continued for some minutes. Had the
assailants waited till the boat had come within range of
the cannon nothing could have saved her. Their impetuosity
defeated their attempt. As it was, the escape
of the boat was considered miraculous. The Sisters afterwards
met a gentleman who had been among the Confederates
at Glasgow on that occasion. He told them that
the Southerners never could account for the escape of the
“Sioux City.” There were five hundred infantry on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
right bank and one thousand cavalry on the left. No one
on board was wounded, but the craft was very much
damaged. The pilot-house was completely riddled, as the
Confederates had aimed particularly at the helmsman. The
Southerners afterwards declared they did not know there
were women on board when they fired on the boat, above
all, the Sisters, for they were especially courteous to all
who wore the religious habit. During the danger the
other ladies were placed by the officers in the part of
the boat which was least exposed. The Sisters stood in
readiness to wait on the wounded, but blessed God that
there were none such this time. When all peril was over
one of the Sisters caused much amusement by saying “I
continued to say my office all through the firing, so that
I might have it finished before being shot.”</p>

<p>During the return voyage much apprehension was
felt, because the Confederates were supposed to be in
ambush at different points. About ten miles below Glasgow
the boat stuck in a sand-bar, and the efforts of the
men to release her were more terrifying than the Southern
bullets. This was the last attempt made to reach
Lexington. Meanwhile Colonel Mulligan’s brigade of two
thousand men was surrounded by Price’s men, supposed
to number twenty thousand. For three days the brigade
made a gallant resistance. Their supply of water had
been cut off for forty-eight hours, when they surrendered
to General Price, September 20, 1861. The General proved
himself a generous enemy, and his conduct won the esteem
and gratitude of his distinguished prisoner. The
two men became sincere friends before they parted.</p>

<p>The Sisters continued to occupy the Mosely residence.
They experienced the greatest kindness and respect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
from the colored people left in charge of it. To the simple
souls they were a great curiosity.</p>

<p>The old housekeeper wanted all her friends to come
to see the Sisters, and numbers responded to her ardent
invitations. These guests were puzzled to account for
the want of resemblance between persons related to each
other, as they thought, in the first degree. “You say this
lady is your sister,” said one, “but she doesn’t look like
you at all, nor this one, either.” It took some time to
make them understand that the relationship was not
in blood, but in spirit and profession.</p>

<p>The Jefferson City Hospital for the sick and wounded
was placed under the care of the Sisters. This charge
they readily undertook at the request of the authorities,
as their original project of going to Lexington had proved
impracticable. They found the poor soldiers in wretched
condition. The hospital, a very recently established institution,
had not yet sufficient furniture. Convalescing
soldiers, who were the only nurses, could not be expected
to bestow on the sick the tender care they required. No
woman of a religious order had ever before been seen in
Jefferson, and such of the soldiers as had heard of them
had heard little that was construed to their advantage.
The Sisters, therefore, on taking charge of the hospital
met with a very cold reception. They showed neither
surprise nor annoyance at this, and very soon the coldness
and prejudice disappeared, being followed by appreciation
and gratitude.</p>

<p>On entering the hospital they found a poor soldier
in a woefully neglected condition, lying on a blanket laid
on the floor. One of the Sisters requested the nurse to
allow her to have a little water. When she received it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
she knelt beside the poor sufferer and bathed his face and
hands. The nurse, a rather stern person, stood by during
the process.</p>

<p>“May I ask, madam,” said he when she finished, “is
that man a relative of yours?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” she replied, “I never saw him before; we
are here to take care of the sick, and we attend every
patient as we would our nearest and dearest relative.”</p>

<p>In a short time the Sisters, by their self-devotion, had
gained the good will of the inmates and officers; and the
hospital began to wear a better appearance. It took a
good while, however, for the citizens and soldiers to become
so accustomed to the Sisters as always to recognize
them as such. One morning, as they were going processionally
to Mass they met a new detachment of soldiers,
who stepped aside to allow them the sidewalk.
They kept a respectful silence until the Sisters had passed,
when one turning to another inquired, “Who’s dead?”</p>

<p>When General Fremont and his staff came to Jefferson
they at once visited the sick soldiers. Desiring to
have an interview with the Sisters the General was
shown to their apartment just as they had assembled for
their frugal meal. When he knocked the door was opened,
and, to their great astonishment, he and his staff, in brilliant
uniform, stood before them. The interview was a
very pleasant one. General Fremont was on all occasions
most courteous to them, and granted everything they
asked. Eloquently did they represent to him the wants
of the poor soldiers, for whom he promised to provide, and
his promises were religiously kept. This officer was
noted for his kindness to his soldiers, especially the sick.</p>

<p>The Sisters also received several visits from Colonel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Mulligan and his brave little wife, an old pupil of theirs.
When she heard of her husband’s capture, although she
had but just recovered from a severe illness, she made her
way across the country to Lexington, to comfort him by
her presence. Soon after he was paroled, and they journeyed
homeward together, stopping at Jefferson on their
way. Mrs. Mulligan gave the Sisters a glowing account
of her husband’s exploits, and moved them to tears by
her description of his sufferings. She was proud of him,
for he was a genuinely brave man. To rare merit he
added rare modesty, and were it not for the animated
recital of his devoted wife the Sisters would have heard
but little of his thrilling adventures in Lexington.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March, 1863, an incident occurred in
Mulligan’s Irish Brigade which, while not dealing with
the labors of the Sisters, was of such an unusual character
as to deserve mention. It was the presentation of a
purse to Rev. Thaddeus J. Butler, D. D., the chaplain, by
the Protestant members of the regiment. The following
address accompanied the purse:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Rev. and Dear Sir:&mdash;We, the undersigned, Protestant
members of the Twenty-third Regiment Illinois Volunteers,
and O’Rourke Battery attached thereto, have
learned with deep and sincere regret of your intention
to leave us. From our long and happy association with
you, and the many kindnesses we have experienced at
your hands, we cannot permit you to depart without expressing
to you the heartfelt sentiments we feel toward
you. The earnestness, zeal and untiring energy you have
displayed for the welfare of all connected with the regiment,
the kindly and deep solicitude and manly courtesy
which at all times we have experienced at your hands,
your sterling worth, so nobly tried in the hour of danger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
have won for you all our hearts and gained your admiration
and respect. In parting with you we feel that we
have lost a dear and valued friend, a good counselor, and
a Christian gentleman, and we assure you carry with
you our sincere wishes for your welfare wherever your
duty may call you. Wishing you a kind farewell and that
God may bless you, we remain.</p></blockquote>

<p>The signatures followed this.</p>

<p>Colonel Mulligan presented the purse in the presence
of the officers and orderly sergeants of the regiment and
in doing so said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Rev. and Dear Sir:&mdash;Our gallant brigade desires me
to present to you as an earnest of their respect and affection
the accompanying purse. To us all in every situation
you have proved yourself the devoted friend and the
exemplary priest. Our hearts are with you.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the soldiers, writing to the Freeman’s Journal
of this remarkable event, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When the Protestants of our regiment address words
of so much affection and attachment to our beloved chaplain,
how are the Catholics, his own co-religionists, for
whom he has labored zealously and devotedly, to testify
their sorrow at his departure from them? Words can but
inadequately do so.</p>

<p>“Our separated brethren proved in a substantial manner
the sincerity of their declaration by contributing liberally
to the purse which was donated to him. They
worked upon our rustic church as eagerly as those for
whose benefit it was constructed. The amiable Captain
Simison, an ardent admirer of Dr. Butler, superintended
the work. Our late worthy and accomplished chaplain
was necessitated to return to his own congregation at Chicago,
which has been bereft of his ministry. General Kelley
with his staff came from Cumberland to bid him farewell.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
The General held him in esteem and regretted his
departure. Last evening the reverend doctor passed
through the quarters and bade good-by to the several companies;
afterward the men assembled at the depot, being
anxious to obtain the last glimpse of him. Lines were
formed by the men, between which he passed on entering
the train; hands were extended on both sides, half of
which he could not grasp. After entering the carriage,
and when it was in motion, many others shook hands
with him. The enlivening airs of Erin were played by
the band. Captain Gleason called for three cheers for Dr.
Butler, which were responded to with deafening plaudits.
Colonel Mulligan came on the train from Cumberland, and
with many of the officers accompanied the Doctor a short
distance from the station.</p>

<p>“Dr. Butler organized a temperance society here last
fall. Being painfully sensible of the baneful effects of intemperance,
the predominating sin of our race, he administered
the pledge to almost 400 of the men. Although it
has not eradicated the vice, it has checked it in a great
measure. Many of the officers set the good example by
joining the movement. The Colonel is president of the
society, the Lieutenant Colonel is vice president. Father
Butler did not pledge them for life; only during the term
of their enlistment while they were under his spiritual
care. Lieutenant Nugent invited the reverend doctor and
most of the officers to supper last evening, where a bounteous
table was spread for them, and good cheer prevailed.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is in order to state here that on the 20th of December,
1861, Mr. Arnold, rising in his seat in the House
of Representatives, at Washington, introduced a joint
resolution giving the thanks of Congress to Colonel
James A. Mulligan and the officers and men under his
command for the heroic defense of Lexington, Missouri,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
which was read a first and second time. The joint resolution
was as follows:</p>

<p>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
that the thanks of Congress be extended to Colonel
James A. Mulligan and the gallant officers and soldiers
under his command, who bravely stood by him against
a greatly superior force in his heroic defense of Lexington,
Missouri.</p>

<p>Resolved, That the Twenty-third Regiment of Illinois
Volunteers&mdash;the Irish Brigade&mdash;in testimony of
their gallantry on that occasion are authorized to bear
on their colors the word “Lexington.”</p>

<p>Resolved, That the Secretary of War be requested to
communicate these resolutions to Colonel Mulligan and
his officers and soldiers.</p>

<p>The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time and, being engrossed, it was accordingly
read a third time and passed<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>.</p>

<p>Rev. William Walsh, of Jefferson City, was a sincere
friend of the Sisters during their abode in the hospital,
and they remember him with lively gratitude. On New
Year’s Day, 1862, they made their renewal of vows in the
church. They also derived much comfort and support
from the many kind and encouraging letters they received
from their superior, Rev. Mother Francis. The
warmest sympathies of this noble-hearted woman were
aroused for her children, working in a cause so dear and
sacred. She visited them during the fall, and frequently
sent them contributions, provisions and delicacies for their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
sick soldiers. These soon became so numerous that two
more Sisters and several elderly women and young girls
were sent to their aid. An additional hospital was required,
and a building formerly used as a seminary was
devoted to that purpose. The assistants of the Sisters
wore a uniform of gray, and as all went to Mass every
morning, when hospital duties permitted, the procession
of the black and gray-robed maidens looked rather solemn.</p>

<p>Except in case of Catholics the ministrations of the
Sisters were confined to the bodily ills of the sick. They
rarely touched on religious subjects, save when the patient
desired it. On one occasion they found a dying man whom
they believed to be a Catholic. The Sisters who attended
him asked him to what church he belonged. He looked
cautiously around the ward and whispered:</p>

<p>“I am ashamed to tell.”</p>

<p>“But,” said she, “you should not belong to a church
of which you are ashamed.”</p>

<p>The poor man then acknowledged that he was a
Catholic, though, through human respect, he had concealed
it until then. The Sister spoke words of advice
and encouragement to the poor man&mdash;a brave soldier of
earth, an indifferent soldier of Christ&mdash;and had the consolation
of inducing him to receive the sacraments. His
death took place soon after, and his fellow-soldiers, having
arrayed him in his uniform, placed upon his bosom
the crucifix which the Sister had given him. This act
of reverence in men who seldom gave religion a thought
surprised and pleased the Sisters not a little.</p>

<p>They remained in charge of the Jefferson City Hospital
until April, 1862, when, the army having been ordered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
to another division, their services were no longer
required. They, therefore, made preparations to return
to Chicago. The night before the day appointed for their
departure they were much surprised by receiving a serenade
from the military band. Next morning Father
Welsh said Mass in the hospital. The Sisters then bade
“good-bye” to the few soldiers who remained, and the
poor fellows were very much affected at the parting.</p>

<p>When the Sisters reached St. Louis they were waited
on by Mr. Yateman, Sanitary Commissioner, who requested
them to take charge of the hospital department of the
steamboat “Empress,” then about to start for the battlefield
of Shiloh, in order to transfer the wounded to places
where they could receive proper care. Many of the sick
and wounded were on the battlefield, sheltered only by
tents, and deprived of almost every comfort. When the
necessary permission from home was obtained the Sisters
went aboard the “Empress,” bound for Pittsburg Landing,
which they reached on Palm Sunday. They had been
anxious to reach it that day, hoping to be in time for
Mass; but they were surprised and disappointed to find
that, instead of being a town or village, Pittsburg Landing
consisted of only one house, a log cabin, in which there
was no prospect of hearing Mass. They went ashore at
once to visit the sick and wounded of both armies, who
were in separate tents, and distributed to the poor men
some refreshments, which were most gratefully received.
Next day the “Empress,” laden with sick and wounded,
started for Keokuk, Iowa. There were over three hundred
sufferers aboard, and the Sisters were occupied from
early morning till midnight waiting on them and endeavoring
to soothe their depressed spirits. The “Empress”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
reached Keokuk on Holy Saturday, April 16, 1862. The
removal of the sick to the hospital began at once and
occupied two days, during which time the Sisters were
engaged in doing everything possible to ease the pains of
their patients.</p>

<p>On Easter Sunday they had the happiness of hearing
Mass and receiving the sacraments. The Sisters of Notre
Dame, who were present at Mass, awaited the Sisters of
Mercy at the church doors, and, knowing they were fasting,
invited them to come to their convent to breakfast. Much
as the Sisters appreciated their kindness, they were
obliged to decline, as they had to return as quickly as possible
to their sick on the hospital boat. In the evening
the Visitation Nuns sent a message to invite the Sisters
of Mercy to dine at their convent. This invitation was
accepted, as the sick and wounded had had their wounds
dressed, and were made as comfortable as possible. At
the Visitation Convent they received much kindness, and
had the happiness of being present at benediction. At
Mound City the Holy Cross Sisters, under Mother Angela
Gillespie, showed much kindness to the Sisters of Mercy.</p>

<p>Next day the “Empress” returned to Pittsburg Landing
for another cargo of the sick, who were conveyed to
St. Louis. The boat made many voyages of this kind. The
Sisters strove to get delicacies of all sorts for the sick
wherever they landed, and in distributing these there
were scenes at once amusing and touching. The men
would gather around the Sisters like big children, holding
out their piece of bread and begging for “just one little
bit of jam.” The Sisters, not having the heart to refuse
anyone, would give away all they had, trusting to kind
Providence to send them more. The “Empress” also made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
a voyage to Louisville, where the Sisters placed under
proper care the last cargo of the sick and wounded from
the terrible battle of Shiloh. The end of May, 1862, concluded
five weeks’ service on the hospital boat. To this
day the Sisters of Mercy express gratitude for the kindness
and almost reverential courtesy they experienced
during their stay with the invalid soldiers. Accustomed
to a life of seclusion and tranquillity, they did not venture
on this undertaking without nerving themselves to
encounter much that might be repugnant to their nature
and profession. But none of their gloomy anticipations
were realized. They always felt that they owed a special
tribute to the brave men of both armies for the deference
and courtesy they invariably received from Confederate
and Federal alike. The soldiers under their care showed
them a child-like docility and respect, and never was a
word uttered in their presence by a warrior of either side
that could offend the most delicate ear. “If,” writes one
of the survivors of the nursing band, “the man who knows
how to treat a woman with respect is himself worthy of
respect, then all honor to the soldiers of the war, North
and South.”

<div id="i_247" class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_247.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>In the autumn of 1862 application was made by the
authorities in Washington to the Mother Superior of the
Sisters of Mercy for nurses to take charge of the wounded
soldiers in the Stanton Hospital
in Washington City. Accordingly,
four Sisters from the mother
house in Pittsburg were appointed
for the work. They hastily
prepared and departed for the
scene of duty, arriving in Washington
the day before Thanksgiving.
Finding that the Stanton,
a long row of one-story
frame buildings, was not quite ready for occupancy, the
Sisters remained for a few days with the Sisters of Mercy,
who were in charge of the Douglas Hospital then in
operation in Washington. These Sisters were members
of the Baltimore Community, founded some years previously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
from the house at Pittsburg. In a short time the
new hospital was opened, and the Sisters repaired thither,
and began their work by caring for one hundred and
thirty wounded soldiers, who had just been carried in
from an engagement. On December 8 four more Sisters
arrived from Pittsburg, making in all eight, which number
constituted the staff of Sisters engaged in the Stanton
Hospital. Some of these did not remain until the close
of the war, but were relieved as circumstances required
by Sisters from home. These changes were not made
without necessity, as the health of several of the original
volunteers was hopelessly shattered by the severe duties
entailed upon them. To the bodily fatigue incident to
the care of so many patients was added much mental
anxiety, caused by the responsibility attending the charge
of grave cases. The successful issue in many severe surgical
operations depended almost entirely on the vigilance
of the nurse.</p>

<p>Too much praise cannot be given to the officials of
the Stanton Hospital for their careful supervision and
attention to the patients, and the unvarying kindness and
confidence reposed in the Sisters. The surgeon in charge,
Dr. John A. Liddell, and his assistant, Dr. Philip Davis,
deserve special mention. Abundant supplies of everything
needful for the sick were most liberally provided. As far
as possible no want of the patients was left ungratified.</p>

<p>This was a source of great satisfaction to the Sisters,
and lightened their cares considerably. What has been
said of the work of Sisters in other hospitals might be
repeated here. Their labors were arduous and unceasing.
After every battle numbers of wounded were brought in,
and received unwearied attention day and night. As a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
rule the soldiers appreciated the work of the Sisters,
and regarded them as their best friends. Often patients,
when convinced that the hope of recovery was gone, confided
their last wishes to the Sisters. They were frequently
called upon to send messages to the loved ones
far away, and write letters to absent friends. These and
similar acts of kindness, with words of comfort and encouragement,
made the day more than full “pressed
down and running over” with meritorious acts. The
Sisters frequently had the consolation of witnessing
happy deathbed scenes, often of persons who, under less
favorable surroundings might not have enjoyed this
great blessing. Entire freedom of conscience was secured
to all, each patient being at liberty to summon to his side
the spiritual adviser of his choice. The Catholics were
attended by the Jesuit Fathers, among whom Revs.
Father Wagit, Brady and Roccofort were untiring in their
efforts to console the sick and fortify the dying with the
consolations of religion. The Sisters remained at the
Stanton until the close of the war, when, their services
being no longer required, they returned to Pittsburg,
where they resumed their usual avocations.</p>

<p>The Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburg
was used by the Government for a military hospital at
this time, principally for Pennsylvania soldiers. Such
men as were able to bear the fatigue of transportation
from Washington or other places were sent to this institution
in order to make room at the Stanton for cases direct
from the field of battle. The Sisters of Mercy were invited
to give their services, a request with which they
cheerfully complied, early in 1863. In this institution the
Sisters experienced the same courtesy from the officers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
as was extended to them elsewhere. Every arrangement
compatible with existing circumstances was made to
lighten their duties. In both these hospitals a chapel was
fitted up and Mass was celebrated daily, which such convalescent
patients as desired were at liberty to attend.
The Sisters continued their work in the Pennsylvania
Hospital until May, 1865. In Washington and Pittsburg
the members of the Sanitary Commission gave very efficient
aid towards alleviating the conditions of the patients
by providing delicacies and reading matter. After
each visit supplies were left in the hands of the Sisters
to be distributed at their discretion.</p>

<p>The Douglas Hospital in Washington had been erected
out of three large dwellings in the then fashionable
part of the Capital City. It was so named from the fact
that the most important of these three houses had been
the residence of the famous Senator of that name.</p>

<p>Sister M. Collette O’Connor was in charge of this institution,
and was revered by all who became acquainted
with her. She died at the hospital, July 16, 1864, and her
remains were escorted to Baltimore and buried with military
honors.</p>

<p>One day President Lincoln visited the Stanton Hospital
in Washington. Those who were fortunate to be present
on this remarkable occasion received impressions that
should remain ever fresh in their minds. None of the
Sisters had ever met the Chief Executive, but when a
tall, angular man with just the suggestion of a stoop about
the shoulders sauntered up the path leading to the main
entrance of the hospital they intuitively knew that it
was President Lincoln. The homely, wrinkled face, with
its careworn appearance, and the patient, almost pathetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
eyes appealed at once to the tender sensibilities of the
Sisters. They knew little, and were without leisure to
inquire, about the merits of either the Northern or Southern
side of the bloody controversy then raging at its
height, but they had a keen appreciation of human suffering
and human sympathy, and their hearts went out
at once to this plain man who so uncomplainingly carried
the woes of the nation upon his shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_251" src="images/i_251.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GRANT, SHERMAN AND SHERIDAN.</p></div>

<p>The President went from cot to cot shaking hands
with the poor patients and addressing them in the jocular
manner he frequently employed to conceal the anguish
caused by the sight of so much suffering. On occasions
of this character the very simplicity and naturalness of
the President only served to bring his greatness into
brighter relief. The Sisters had a good opportunity of
observing the man who had been called from his modest
home in Illinois to become ruler of the Republic at the
most serious crisis in its history. They saw in him a
person who with a single stroke of the pen was destined
to liberate nearly four millions of slaves. They saw a
man who was daily performing the most painful duties
under the most trying circumstances, but who did each
act “with malice toward none; with charity for all.”
They saw in him the one distinctively grand figure of the
war. They realized with others that amid the clash and
roar and smoke of battle; amid the perplexities and contentions
of legislative halls, and the difficulties and differences
of Cabinets, there arose pre-eminent above all
the peaceful, pathetic, powerful personality of Abraham
Lincoln.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln remained at the hospital for some time.
With the trained eye of a man of affairs he observed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
cleanliness of the place, and did not fail to notice all that
the Sisters were doing for the comfort and relief of the
patients. When he departed he cordially shook hands
with each of the Sisters, and congratulated them on the
work they were performing in the cause of humanity.</p>

<p>Rev. J. F. Regis Canevin, rector of St. Paul’s Cathedral,
Pittsburg, has paid a high tribute to the work of
the Sisters of Mercy in the late war.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> A passing reference
is made to some of the events already detailed in this
chapter, but it is such an able presentation of the case
that it deserves reproduction in these pages. Father
Canevin said in part:</p>

<p>“The Sisters went forth from their peaceful convent
homes to serve their God and country in the Stanton
Military Hospital at Washington and in the Western
Pennsylvania Hospital at Pittsburg. The military physicians
regarded them as valuable assistants, and oftentimes
the nuns had the entire charge of the patients, administering
of medicines and arranging bandages with
deft and skillful hands.</p>

<p>“The Sisters had four hundred and fifty wounded
men under their care in the Stanton Hospital at one time,
and after the second battle of Fredericksburg, December
13, 1862, a number of Confederate wounded were laid side
by side with those whom they had wounded.</p>

<p>“‘It was a beautiful sight,’ said one of the Sisters, ‘to
see how tenderly the convalescent Union soldiers helped
to nurse back the health of those whom they had so
fiercely fought a short time before. Those who are first
in war are also first in peace.’</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘The bravest are the tenderest,’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“‘The loving are the daring.’”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>“Southern sympathizers in Washington sent large
supplies of provisions and delicacies for their Confederate
friends. ‘We took all they sent,’ said a veteran Sister, ‘but
we saw that the boys in blue fared as well as their foes.’
This was holy simplicity. At the time the Sisters were
engaged in their work of mercy in the hospitals and on
the battlefields of the North some of their companions
who had left their side a few years before were under the
shot and shell which were hurled from land and water
when Grant besieged Vicksburg, and fear and famine
stalked the Confederate camp and city. The Sisters followed
the ill-fated army through all the hard fortunes of
the struggle; nursed the sick, stanched the blood, bound
up the wounds of those who fell on the battlefield, and
spoke words of consolation and hope to the dying.</p>

<p>“We can read in military annals how the dying soldier
fancied a mother or a sister to be supporting his
head as the black-robed nun bade him confide in the
Saviour of Calvary, and poured refreshing drops on his
lips parched and quivering in the throes of death. It
was loyalty to the Divine Master that caused these women
to serve on both sides of the line.</p>

<p>“After the war the Vicksburg Community returned
to their convent and found their latest golden opportunity
in the South in the great yellow fever scourge of 1878,
which spread sorrow and gloom over the land, until even
hope was almost paralyzed. Yes, when fear had dissolved
all the ties which hold society together; when succor
could not be bought with gold; when the strongest natural
affections yielded to the love of life, then a band of Sisters
of Mercy, led by the same fearless heroines from
Pittsburg who fifteen years before had seen duty on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
battlefield, were to be found bending over the plague-stricken
couch, praying, ever encouraging and holding up
to the last before the expiring patient the image of the
Cross.</p>

<p>“When the brave men of both armies had fought out
the nation’s quarrel, and when the roar of cannon died
away and the smoke of battle was lifted from the land,
the bright sun of peace shone upon a people more united
than they had ever been before. Religious bigotry and
sectarian hatred had received a deadly stroke. There
was more Christianity amid the rough scenes of war than
there had been in preceding years of peace. The best
blood of the Roman Catholic and of the Protestant co-patriot
had reddened the same stream and mingled on
many a well-fought field; side by side they met the charge;
side by side they repelled the shock; side by side they fell.
In the same pit their bodies were deposited. The dew fell
from Heaven upon their union in the grave.</p>

<p>“Misfortune had taught them to know and respect
and trust and love each other. Those who survived learned
to despise the cowards and hypocrites and bigots who
at home, in ignorance or malice, had armed man against
his brother, and in the name of religion kept us in perpetual
conflict. The soldier descendant of the New England
Puritan, and of the Papist-hating Orangeman, discovered
that his Catholic comrade was a brave, generous-hearted
man, and a consistent Christian; that the Roman
Catholic Church was not the sworn enemy of free institutions;
that the Sisters of that Church were kind, earnest,
hard-working, useful and devoted women in the service
of that Christ whose doctrine is that we should love one
another. And thus the Sisters of Mercy returned from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
war to find the good they and other religious women had
done had won the grateful recognition of the whole country.
Thoughtful men learned from their deeds that even
a Covenanter need not fear to offend the Creator in
acknowledging that there rested a holy influence in hearts
consecrated to God.”</p>

<p>A Sister of Mercy at Charleston, under date of September
23, 1865, thus writes to a friend concerning
the destitution in that city and State:</p>

<p>“Every phase of life has been so upturned here that
the once rich, who were wont to assist the poor, are now
wretchedly poor themselves, and are grateful for a little
of the common necessaries of life when given them. We
have called upon the Northern storekeepers here and received
some assistance from them, but we cannot call too
often. Few of our own people are able to go into business;
none can afford to give at present, though the will
is good. If, my dear lady, you can do aught in this emergency,
you will perform a great act of charity. Could
you see these people as we do your heart would ache. Sad
eyes swimming in tears; little delicate hands skinned from
the wash-tub, and hearts without hope for the future. I
saw last week a lady, one of the wealthiest a short time
ago, lying on a miserable pallet, the room without furniture,
where she once had every comfort. The house had
been stripped of everything, linen, plate and wines of all
kinds; her limbs were covered with sores, occasioned by anxiety
of mind and poverty of blood; the result of almost starvation.
Were this an isolated case, it could be relieved,
but, unfortunately, the city abounds in them. The planters
for miles around are homeless, and are compelled to
take refuge in the city without any means of subsistence.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<p>Sisters DeSales and DeChantel, and some five other
Sisters of the Sisters of Mercy arrived in New York in
the latter part of 1865 from White Sulphur Springs, Montgomery
County, Virginia, where they were engaged attending
the sick and wounded soldiers in the hospital for
the last four years. They were accompanied by the Rev.
Mr. Croghan, of Charleston, who was also engaged during
the war as chaplain in the same hospital.</p>

<p>According to the New York News, at the time of
Lee’s surrender there were over three hundred sick and
wounded at this particular hospital. It adds: “Over
sixty of these were Federal soldiers, and not more than
two days’ rations to meet their wants. The Sisters
were among strangers, having neither money nor worldly
influence, but, compelled by the spirit of their holy
calling, they devised means to procure provisions enough
to suffice for more than six weeks for the patients and
remained with them until all had either convalesced or
died.</p>

<p>“About the 22d of May they proceeded to Lynchburg.
General Gregg received them at this port most courteously
and offered them every means in his power to prosecute
their journey to Washington, where they again applied
to General Hardie for transportation to Charleston. In
this they were not successful. General Hardie refused to
send them, on the ground that, being non-combatants, no
provision had been made by the authorities in Washington
for such persons. Finally, through the kindness of
some private gentleman in Washington, Father Croghan
was enabled to procure transportation to New York, where
they found themselves strangers and penniless, and with
hardly sufficient wearing apparel to enable them to appear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
in public. On hearing of their embarrassing circumstances,
the Rev. William Quinn, of St. Peter’s, Barclay
street, called a few of his parishioners together on Sunday
last with a view to raising the necessary funds to enable
these good Sisters to return to their homes. The result
was that, aided by Judge Andrew Clarke, Esq., and
a few other gentlemen, the sum of eleven hundred and
forty-eight dollars was collected in a few days. On Saturday
last this amount was presented to Sister DeSales,
at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, in Seventeenth street,
by a committee consisting of the Rev. William Quinn, Dennis
Quinn and Andrew Clarke. On receiving the amount
Sister DeSales, on behalf of herself and the community she
represented, expressed her earnest thanks to the donors,
promising that their kindness should never be forgotten by
their community.”</p>

<p>The Convent at Charleston belonging to these Sisters
was burned to the ground, having caught fire from the
shells thrown into the city during the bombardment of
the Federal forces.

<p>In January, 1862, Dr. Henry H. Smith, Surgeon-General
of the State of Pennsylvania, applied to Rev. Mother
St. John at the Mt. St. Joseph Convent, Chestnut Hill,
Philadelphia, for Sisters to serve as
nurses of the sick soldiers in Camp Curtin,
Harrisburg, saying he had had experience
of the Sisters’ efficiency in nursing
while he attended at St. Joseph’s
Hospital in Philadelphia, and felt they
would be able to do good work at the
State Capital.</p>

<p>Bishop Wood, to whom the Doctor
had spoken of the matter, gave ready
assent, and writing on the 22d of the same month,
the Doctor speaks of the arrangements for the Sisters’
journey as having been effected, and adds: “The Doctor
hopes the Sisters will not disappoint him. Whilst beset
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
by applicants, every female nurse has been refused, Dr.
Smith being unwilling to trust any but his old friends,
the Sisters of St. Joseph. There is a large field of usefulness,
but it is to be properly cultivated only by those
whose sense of duty will induce them to sacrifice personal
comfort. The living is rough, the pay poor, and nothing
but the sentiments of religion can render the nurses
contented.”</p>

<p>On January 23 three Sisters under the direction of
Mother Monica Pue, went to Harrisburg, and on the following
day the Surgeon-General took them to Camp Curtin
Hospital, which he placed under their charge. At the
camp there were then about three thousand militia. The
hospital was merely a temporary frame building, roughly
put together, and to make the apartments at all habitable
blankets and other such improvised tapestry had to be
hung over the boards. The Sisters arrived at the hospital
towards evening. They found that three matrons had
been in charge, and with them a number of the soldiers
acting as nurses. The reception accorded the Sisters
was not at all cordial. One man had been given the charge
of seeing to the Sisters’ wants, and, coming to them he
asked what they wished to have for supper, saying: “I
know that the discipline of the Church is bread and
water, but I do not know what you ladies may want to
have.” The Sisters replied that anything would do, and
were shortly afterwards summoned to the table the nurses
had just left in a most uninviting condition. The viands
were left untasted, and the Sisters began to see what work
was before them, and to arrange matters accordingly.</p>

<p>It was not long before the sick soldiers as well as
those employed in the hospital began to feel the beneficial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
effects of the Sisters’ care, and their efficiency in hospital
administration; and the respectful attentions and military
salutes of the men became almost oppressive. Bishop
Wood paid several visits to the Sisters at the camp, and
also to the Church Hospital, Harrisburg, where three
Sisters, under charge of Sr. Mary John, afterward the
Rev. Mother of the Community, took charge of the sick,
who, among the arriving militia, were unable to proceed
as far as the camp.</p>

<p>Finding themselves always addressed by the physicians
as “Sisters of Charity” or “Mercy,” the Sisters
drew the Surgeon-General’s attention to the misnomer,
but he replied that the name accorded with their work,
and it would be no use in trying to explain to the doctors
about the different orders. Hence in all newspaper reports
and in various accounts of their work given at the
time the Sisters were always mentioned as Sisters of
Charity or Mercy, which they took as another sign that
their patron, St. Joseph, desired them to labor as he
had done, in silence and obscurity, unknown and unnoticed
by the world.</p>

<p>On the 2d of February the Surgeon-General, after
visiting the hospitals, wrote to Mother St. John: “I have
found all the Sisters perfectly well, and with no complaints
after their trial of the inconveniences and exposure
attendant on military life. Already each hospital
shows the blessing attendant on their presence. Everything
is now neat, orderly and comfortable. Sr. P. is ‘Captain
of the Ward’ in the camp hospital, and has a drummer
boy to attend her. Sister C. in the kitchen is also in
authority, and has a sentry at the kitchen door. * * *
Sr. M. is ‘the Major,’ and commands the surgeons, keeping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
them in good humor by her kind acts. All seem happy
and contented, and the Governor and others speak frequently
of the good move made in bringing them there.
* * * At the Church Hospital Sister C. shines in
the refectory, and everything is in excellent order.”</p>

<p>On the 18th of the same month the doctor called
for more Sisters, adding, however, “Matters are so unsettled
by the recent victories I am at a loss whether to
send for extra help. There are rumors of closing the
camp or rather of giving it up to the United States.”</p>

<p>What Dr. Smith had anticipated came to pass; the
soldiers at Camp Curtin were called to the front, and
the Sisters left the Church Hospital March 27, and Camp
Curtin April 8, ’62. It was indeed touching to see the
difference between the reception the men had given the
Sisters on their coming and the feeling of sorrow that
marked their parting with them. Many of the men sobbed
aloud, and the Sisters themselves were deeply moved
at the thought of how many, who were starting off in
health and strength, would ere long meet a sad and
painful death.</p>

<p>On the 14th of April, by order of Governor Curtin,
the following letter was sent by Dr. Smith to Madam St.
John, Superior of the Sisters of St. Joseph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Madam:&mdash;During a period of several weeks, amidst
the confusion of a constantly changing camp, and amidst
an epidemic of measles, with typhoid fever, etc., six of
‘The Sisters of St. Joseph,’ sacrificing all personal comfort,
ministered faithfully and truly to the comfort and
welfare of the sick. Neatness, order and efficient ministration
immediately followed their arrival in the camp.</p>

<p>“Highly appreciating their valuable services and
Christian devotion to the relief of human suffering, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
State authorities desire to express to them and your order
high appreciation of the self-sacrificing spirit which they
exhibited among the sick soldiers, both at Camp Curtin
and the Church Hospital in Harrisburg.</p>

<p>“By order of</p>

<p class="author">
“A. G. CURTIN, Governor of Pennsylvania.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Smith himself wrote:&mdash;“It affords me pleasure to
transmit the accompanying order, acknowledging the
valuable services of the Sisters recently engaged at Harrisburg.
* * * In the event of a fight at Yorktown
I shall go there with a party on a steamboat and stop
at Fortress Monroe. If some hardy Sisters will volunteer
for duty with me I will perhaps be able to take them. The
notice will not be more than six hours. * * * I will
share the exposure with them, and will do all that is possible
to make them comfortable, bringing them back
with the wounded, unless you allow them to stay. Your
Order is, I believe, the only one that is doing duty with
the army. I think they can do much good, under my
care. Sr. &mdash;&mdash; will be especially useful in cooking for
the wounded in the boat I shall take at the Fortress.”</p>

<p>On the 18th the orders came, and, under the escort
of Captain Bankson, U. S. A., three Sisters went to Baltimore
and thence to Fortress Monroe. On the 26th the
Doctor sent a request for six more Sisters, promising
plenty of occupation.</p>

<p>In a letter dated April 27, 1862, Archbishop Wood,
after naming the Sisters detailed “for attendance on the
wounded and sick soldiers under the direction of Dr.
Henry Smith, Surgeon-General of the Pennsylvania Volunteers,”
adds “We commend them to the kind care and
protection of the Surgeon-General, and to the attention
of all persons, ecclesiastical and civil, with whom they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
may be in any way associated, holding it as a special and
personal favor bestowed on ourselves.”</p>

<p>On April 21, writing from Fortress Monroe, the Doctor
informs Mother St. John that the Sisters on their arrival
had been put at once on hospital duty, and were doing
much needed work, especially in the preparation of sick
diet, etc. He adds: “They are sure to be appreciated.
* * * They come into friendly competition with a
party of nurses under the direction of Miss Dix. They
will win the good will and opinion of all.”</p>

<p>The three Sisters first sent were again under the
direction of Mother Monica Pue. They were kindly and
eagerly welcomed by Dr. Smith, who, with the aid of a
spy-glass, saw the boat approaching and hurried to meet
them. There were then some sick and wounded on board
the floating hospital, the “Whillden.” Other Sisters went
down later under charge of one of the hospital surgeons,
who, poor man, was anything but pleased with being
detailed to act as escort to five ladies. But all his fears,
as he afterwards declared, were speedily dispelled when
he found his office rather a sinecure, since the Sisters did
not call on him for the thousand and one attentions
it had been his fortune to have been called on to give
while attending secular ladies.</p>

<p>At Fortress Monroe they went aboard the two floating
hospitals, the “Whillden” and the “Commodore.” On
May 3 they had the great consolation of receiving the
Sacraments from Rev. Father Dillon, of the Congregation
of the Holy Cross, who drove up and down the Camp by
Fortress Monroe, hearing the confessions of the soldiers.
He said Mass on board the “Commodore” May 3 and 4.</p>

<p>On May 6, in company with the Surgeon-General and
his assistants, three of the Sisters went down the James
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
River in the “Commodore” to bring up the wounded from
the battlefield of Yorktown. All night from 5 P. M. till
2 A. M. of next day the wounded were being carried to the
vessel on stretchers. Harrowing, indeed, were the scenes
that there met their eye, and sad it was to find how inadequate
were their efforts to fully assuage the terrible
sufferings of the victims. But all that could be done
was done, and the supply of coffee and stimulants was
thankfully received by those who for days had languished
without any attentions. A company of Pennsylvania
Volunteers, whom the Sisters met near the landing had
not had any food for two, and some for three days, the
steamer laden with provisions having been unaccountably
delayed. On their way up the river the “Commodore”
passed the vessel with the longed-for supply of food
on its way down to the men.</p>

<p>Among the wounded were many of the Southern
soldiers, who had been taken prisoners; and they seemed
particularly grateful for the attentions of the religious.
The wounded lay in rows along the decks of the steamers,
and in the state rooms, so close together that it was almost
impossible to pass along without treading on them.</p>

<p>On May 16 Dr. Smith wrote to Mother St. John: “The
Sisters have given universal satisfaction, and have done
much good. It will be acknowledged hereafter in proper
form. In the meantime I should like to take six of them
with me again, ending perhaps at Richmond.” Six of
the Sisters came up with the wounded on the “Commodore”
to the port of Philadelphia, and stayed with them
until they had all been removed to the different hospitals
of the city. After a few days’ rest they returned to receive
the wounded from the battle fought near Richmond.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the camp at Harrisburg had been reopened,
and three Sisters were again called to attend the
hospital. One of them relates that on her rounds about
the place on their return she saw an isolated tent by
the door of which lay a coffin. To her inquiries an officer
replied that in the tent there was a man dying of
camp fever. She inquired whether it was possible to
save the man, and, on hearing that it was not known,
declared her intention of going to see. The officer refused
to allow her to go in, saying it would be suicide, as she
could not go without contracting the fever. She, however,
persisted, and entering the tent, beheld a man in apparently
a state of collapse. For days, it would seem, he had
received very little attention, and the filth of the bed and
floor was indescribable. That day the poor patient had
had nothing but a drink of water. The Sister at once
prepared and gave him a bowl of stimulating broth. He
became sufficiently strong to tell her he was from St.
Paul’s Parish, Philadelphia. The priest, Rev. Father
Maher, of Harrisburg, was sent for. In the meantime, by
dint of warnings and entreaties, the Sister got two of the
male nurses to lift the man from the bed, to which parts
of his body adhered. The floor was cleansed, the man
washed, his sores attended to, and then the priest came,
heard his confession and gave him the last Sacraments,
and immediately his recovery seemed to set in. His
gratitude was touching in the extreme. The Sisters had
word sent to his wife in Philadelphia that she might
be able to have him removed home, but before she came
they themselves had been recalled from what to them was
a blessed field of labor.</p>

<p>On June 9, 1862, Dr. Smith wrote to Mother St. John,
saying: “The United States have agreed to take charge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
of all the State hospitals. * * * I have requested
the Sisters at Harrisburg to return to you and hope I
shall not have again to trouble you until the war is ended.
The Sisters did great good, were very kind and
useful. All will be acknowledged in due time.” Several
of the Sisters who attended the soldiers have already
entered on their reward, and rest in the beautiful cemetery
of Mt. St. Joseph, where on Decoration Day the Sisters
and children love to pay special attention to the
graves of those departed ones “of the Soldiers of Christ
who went out to attend on the soldiers of war.”</p>

<p>No words could adequately express the gratitude of
the Sisters for the delicate and fatherly attentions they
received from Surgeon-General Smith and his corps of
assistants. Dr. Smith was truly “one of Nature’s noblemen,”
with a soul free from every taint of prejudice,
with a heart open to every phase of human suffering and
a charity that never wearied in alleviating the horrors of
war.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>

<p class="hang">The heroic life and labors of Mother Angela. A cousin of the late James G.
Blaine. She gives up her school at South Bend, Ind., to serve through
the war. A historic meeting between Mother Angela and General Grant
Rev. L. A. Lambert, the chaplain at Mound City. Sixty Sisters of the

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i_267" src="images/i_267.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Mother Angela, of the Holy Cross Sisters, was one of
the most devoted nurses in any of the orders that served
during the civil war. She was a woman of high birth and
considerable refinement. She
came from a well-known Pennsylvania
Irish family&mdash;the Gillespies.
It was from this family
that James Gillespie Blaine
was so named. She was a cousin
of the illustrious man, and
was also related to the Ewings
and the Shermans. Her parents
migrated from Pennsylvania
to Illinois while she was quite young, and her education
was received at the Academy of the Visitation, in
Washington, D. C. Mother Angela always had a high regard
for Blaine. She was intimately acquainted with the
details of his early life and his home at Brownsville, Pa.
To those in whom she placed great confidence she frequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
gave touching incidents of the young man’s early career,
and on more than one occasion she repelled slanders which
were no doubt implicitly believed by the public at large.
She became connected with the Holy Cross Sisters many
years before the war. When the first gun was fired at
Sumter Mother Angela was in charge of a flourishing
school at South Bend. When the need for nurses became
pressing this was given up, the scholars returned to their
homes, and the Sister teachers volunteered their services
to those in charge of the hospitals. Mother Angela was
sent out by the Very Rev. Father Sourin, Superior General
of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, whose head
house was at Notre Dame, Indiana.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from the Circular Letter
issued October 21, 1861, by Father Sorin, who was the
founder of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in the United
States:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“My Dear Daughters in Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>“Among the distressing features of the times I am glad
to convey you some consoling news, for, however much we
deplore the distracted state of our country, we find a gratification
in being able to assuage some of its sorrows....</p>

<p>A most honorable call has been made on your community
by the First Magistrate in our State, asking for
twelve Sisters to go and attend the sick, the wounded and
dying soldiers.... The call has been unhesitatingly
responded to, and this afternoon six Sisters of Holy
Cross started for Paducah. Six more start within a week....
They are all chosen from a large number of volunteers;
and if we judge of their sentiments by the joy
with which they have received their selection, we have
reason to believe that they duly appreciate the honor and
favor bestowed upon them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p>“It is well known that in the Crimean War the Sisters
of Charity literally covered themselves with glory before
men, and, doubtless, with merits before God. When the
record of our present struggles will be handed down to posterity
will it not be a source of joy for the Church to be
able to show, in every rank of society, many a glorious
name generously sacrificed for the rescue of the country?</p>

<p>“But why should we be left out of the list? If the
Standard of the Cross, under which we have enlisted,
knows no enemies among men; if our objects, on the contrary,
is to rally them all under the precious emblem of
our salvation, our little army stands arrayed against the
enemy of mankind, the spirit of darkness, and all the evils
and the wounds which he has inflicted on humanity.
Hence, wherever there is a pain to soothe, a pang to relieve,
a bleeding heart or limb to treat or dress, there is a
field for us to enter, under pain of deserting our noble banner....
What a joy it would bring to the apostolic
heart of our venerated founder (Father Moreaux) to hear
of this heroic act of charity undertaken by this little vanguard
of his company in the New World! It is in his name
I have blessed them, and they may rest assured that while
they follow the fortunes of the battlefields of the nation,
he, like Moses, will be praying for them on the mountain
top. We, too, shall persevere with him in prayer in their
behalf. In all our Houses there shall be offered for them a
General Communion every Saturday, that they may fully
discharge the important trust they have received.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mother Angela met many of the great generals of the
war, and they all united in declaring her a woman of marvelous
executive ability. Besides this she had many other
accomplishments of a high order. Although she was the
Mother in charge, she gave her personal attention to many
of the patients. On several historic occasions she waited
upon Confederate and Union soldiers at the same time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
“Johnny Reb,” as he was facetiously called, and the
“Yank” would lie in cots side by side, with the peaceful
face of Mother Angela between them. Often men lying
helpless on their backs would get into heated disputes over
the relative merits of the war, and but for their physical
disability would have done each other violence. The Sisters
alone possessed the power to quell these quarrels,
and they did it with all the tact and diplomacy becoming
their gentle natures.</p>

<p>The story of the first meeting between General Grant
and Mother Angela comes from an eye-witness of that historic
episode, and can be vouched for as strictly correct.
Grant was just then beginning to develop the traits of a
leader, which were to mark him later as the greatest captain
of his time. His headquarters were in an old brick
building that had formerly served as a bank in Cairo.
Mother Angela came to this place to report for duty to
General Grant. She was accompanied by the late Dr.
Brinton, an honored physician of Philadelphia, and Rev.
Louis A. Lambert, D. D., LL. D.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_271" src="images/i_271.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LEE, JACKSON AND BEAUREGARD.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Lambert, who was to act in the capacity of chaplain,
escorted Mother Angela into Grant’s presence. The
great Captain was seated at a desk behind the iron bars,
which had evidently been formerly used by the cashier
of the bank. He was writing with the air of a man who
was absorbed in his task and unconscious of his surroundings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
An ordinary cheap pipe was in his mouth, and every
now and then he mechanically blew forth a cloud of smoke.
The characteristics of the man so well-known in later years
were just as pronounced then. The people all around him
were plainly agitated with the thought of the great war
that was about to rage in all its fury. He sat at his work
calm, silent, and with an imperturbability of countenance
that was sphinx-like. Dr. Brinton, who had been one of
the first to suggest the Sisters, introduced Mother Angela
to Grant. The General came out from behind the iron
grating with his head bare, and, taking Mother Angela’s
hand, gave it a hearty shake. The pipe he had been smoking
was temporarily laid aside. There was a moment’s silence,
and then Grant, looking at his visitor with a pleasant
smile, said:</p>

<p>“I am glad to have you with us, very glad.”</p>

<p>There was a pause for a second, and then he added:</p>

<p>“If there is anything at all I can do for you I will be
glad to do it. I thoroughly appreciate the value of your
services, and I will give orders to see that you do not want
for anything.”</p>

<p>After a few more minutes of general conversation, in
which Dr. Brinton and Father Lambert joined, Mother
Angela and the Sisters started for their mission at Mound
City. In later years General Grant frequently expressed
profound admiration for Mother Angela, not only as a
nurse, but as a woman of unusual ability.</p>

<p>Grant about this period in his career was one of the
most interesting characters of the war. It is curious to note
the various estimates of his character. The following extract
from a letter written from the “front” during the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
closing months of the war furnishes a striking pen picture
of the man:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In his manners, dress and style of living Grant displays
more republican simplicity than any other general
officer in the army. In manner he is very unassuming and
approachable, and his conversation is noticeable from
its unpretending, plain and straightforward style. There
is nothing didactic nor pedantic in his tone or language.
His rhetoric is more remarkable for the compact structure
than the elegance and finish of his sentences. He talks
practically, and writes as he talks, and his language, written
and oral, is distinguished by strong common sense.</p>

<p>“He seldom indulges in figurative language; but
when he does his comparisons betray his habits of close
observation. He dresses in a careless, but by no means
slovenly manner. Though his uniform conforms to army
regulations in cut and trimmings, it is often like that of
Sherman&mdash;worn threadbare. He never wears any article
which attracts attention by its oddity, except, indeed, the
three stars which indicate his rank. His wardrobe when
campaigning is generally very scant, while his headquarters
train is often the smallest in the army. For several
months past he has been living in a log hut of unpretending
dimensions on the James River, sleeping on a common
camp-cot, and eating at a table common to all his
staff, plainly furnished with good roast beef, pork and
beans, ‘hard-tack’ and coffee.</p>

<p>“It is related of the General that when the march
to the rear of Vicksburg began he announced to his army
the necessity of ‘moving light,’ i. e., without extra baggage.
He set an example by sending to the rear all his
baggage except a green briar-root pipe, a tooth-brush and
a horn pocket-comb. The story of his appearance in the
Senate chamber in February last is still fresh in the minds
of the public. He had no sooner left the hall after paying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
his respects to the Senators than one of the Democratic
members rose and asked the consideration of the Senate
upon what he termed the evident and gross mistake which
had been made in appointing Grant a Lieutenant General,
and declared it to be his opinion that ‘there was not a second
lieutenant of the Home Guard of his State who did
not “cut a bigger swell” than this man who had just left
their presence.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mother Angela’s party after leaving General Grant
had quite an experience in reaching their destination.
The wagon which had been detailed as their
conveyance broke down when they were half way thither,
and there was some difficulty in patching it up sufficiently
to finish the journey. But it was done, and the Sisters
eventually reached Mound City, and began their work of
mercy in the hospital located there. Sister Ferdinand
was a fellow laborer with Mother Angela at this time.
Father Lambert, the chaplain, attended the Post Hospital
at Mound City and said Mass at 4 o’clock in the morning
for the benefit of Mother Angela and her Sisters.</p>

<p>There was one incident that was kept quiet and which
did not become generally known until after the war.
Small-pox was raging at the time, and one of the brave Sisters
was stricken down. She was hastily stowed away in
a garret of the hospital building and a special guard placed
over her. She recovered, and after that devoted herself
to nursing others with even more zeal than she had shown
before she was stricken down. Ordinarily small-pox cases
were sent to the pest house, but in this instance the tenderness
of the Sisters would not permit them to part with
their afflicted colleague. It was against the rules, to be
sure, but who can blame the Sisters for this merciful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
breach of discipline? It is only proper to state that the
case was so isolated that not one of the twelve hundred
patients was affected even in the remotest degree. One
who was in the hospital at this time says that he is not certain
but that the Surgeon General knew of the hidden
case.</p>

<p>There were between 1200 and 1400 patients in the hospital,
and all received the kindest care and attention.
Mother Angela served through all the war, winning extraordinary
distinction for tact, diplomacy and faithfulness.</p>

<p>The official communication written by Commander
Davis after a battle on White River, June 17, 1862, indicates
that Mother Angela was not unknown to the
authorities.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>U. S. Flag Steamer Benton, Memphis, June 20, 1862.<br />
Hon. Gideon Wells, Secretary of the Navy.<br /></p>

<p>Sir:&mdash;The number of men on board the hospital boat
Red Rover is forty-one. The account given me yesterday
was incorrect. I shall still wait for further
knowledge before presenting a final report of the casualties
attending the capture of the St. Charles forts.
The Department will be gratified to learn that the patients
are, most of them, doing well. * * * Sister
Angela, the Superior of the Sisters of the Holy Cross
(some of whom are performing their offices of mercy at
the Mound City Hospital), has kindly offered the services
of the Sisters for the hospital boat of this squadron
when needed. I have written to Commander Rennock to
make arrangements for their coming.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully your obedient
servant,</p>

CHARLES H. DAVIS,<br />
Flag Officer Commanding Western Flotilla.<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>The Catholic Mirror, under date of November 8, 1862,
records the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A fourth colony of these devoted Sisterhoods has set
forth on its mission of mercy, to serve in the hospitals of
Washington, as they already serve so faithfully at Memphis,
Cairo and Mound City. The Hospital of St. Aloysius,
erected in a week by Catholic charity, fired by the zeal of
the dead Jesuit Fathers, call them to its succor; and they,
fully responding to the holy fervor which built these hospitals
from the very overflowings of love to God and of reverence
for the tabernacle in which dwells the Holy of Holies,
will fill up the measure of these by ministering to the
wants of the sick and sorrowing and forlorn, the objects
of His love who died on Calvary, and renders daily His
sacrifice for their success, and the holy temple thus saved
by piety from desecration.</p>

<p>“Who has not heard of the Jesuit Fathers? Their
fame has spread throughout the earth; and yet so silently
they work, so sublimely concealed their burning zeal, that
but for an occasion like the present, when the influence
they possess over the human soul manifested itself by a
simultaneous impulse that cannot be repressed, they for
the most part live a hidden, unobtrusive life&mdash;a life which
makes the surer the good they invariably effect&mdash;for near
400 years the devoted sons of St. Ignatius toiled like
their founder in striving to hide from the world the individuals
who achieved a good that will not be hidden; and
it seems a sort of sacrilege to withdraw the veil that hides
this good even partially from the world. When we think
of what the Jesuits have done through long ages, our heart
burns, our spirit fires, and in our heart of hearts perceive
that men who do good in every age, without being tainted
with the spirit of any age, demand from us reverence and
not praise.</p>

<p>“When, then, we heard of the last demonstration of
zeal, of Catholic zeal, stirred up by the Jesuit Fathers, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
felt no extraordinary surprise, we manifested no extraordinary
exultation; a tranquil happiness stole over us;
we thanked God that St. Ignatius still lived in his sons,
and that, great as was the work of building St. Aloysius
Hospitals in six days, a far greater work, though a more
hidden one, is being daily, hourly, performed by these devoted
soldiers of the Church.</p>

<p>“But, meantime, the hospital of St. Aloysius is a
fact; in Washington, hospitals to form a refuge for the
sick, measuring six hundred feet by twenty-six, are in actual
existence, erected spontaneously by Catholic charity,
and purposing to be watched over also by Catholic charity,
for the Sisters of the Holy Cross are already on the way
to take charge of such inmates as this unhappy war shall
bring within its precincts.</p>

<p>“May they prosper in their mission at Washington, as
at Memphis, Mound City and at Cairo; may they bring
balm to the wounded heart as they bandage the wounded
limb; and may the blessings they bring to others react
upon themselves to enable them to lead more and more fully
the life of recollection every true religious covets, even
while pursuing the apparently distracting occupations of
attending the sick and wounded! In bringing to the bedside
the comforts of a soul in constant and habitual communication
with God, by the faithfulness in which are performed
the religious exercises prescribed by the rule, a
Sister of Holy Cross can scarcely fail to dispense treasures
far more valuable than the gold and silver of the world.</p>

<p>“How many are the souls aided in their passage to
eternity! How many reclaimed from a life of sin! How
many taught to bless the temporary suffering which
brought them acquainted with the peace that passeth all
understanding! The annals of these deeds are hidden
now; but on the Day of Judgment they will stand forth and
praise the religious, who, by her spirit of prayer, was enabled
to perform these ‘miracles of the soul.’”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The following communication, signed “P,” and addressed
to the editor of the New York Tablet, on April 12,
1862, is interesting, not only in particularizing the order in
question, but in affording another glimpse of Mother Angela:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In your issue of the 22d I find a notice of the military
hospital at Mound City. There is a mistake in that article
which I am sure you will willingly rectify. The Sisters who
are in charge there are not the ‘Sisters of Charity;’ they
are the ‘Sisters of the Holy Cross,’ from their Convent of
St. Mary’s, St. Joseph’s County, Indiana. Under the direction
of their Superioress, Mother St. Angela, these pious
Sisters have had for some time the charge of the hospitals
at Cairo, Mound City and Paducah. Upon their arrival,
about the beginning of October, all the other female nurses
were dispensed with, and the Sisters assumed the entire
control of the wards, each Sister having the care of one
ward.</p>

<p>“When it became known throughout the West that
Mother Angela and her Sisters had assumed this arduous
position, hundreds of her friends hastened to forward to
her care large supplies of clothing and linen suitable for
hospital purposes. She even made a journey to Chicago
for the purpose of obtaining supplies, and right nobly did
the citizens respond to her call. There are now over thirty
Sisters there, who are almost exhausted by their incessant
labors; they know no rest night or day. Fourteen hundred
wounded men are hourly receiving at their hands
such care as can only be bestowed by pious souls who
look for their reward not on earth but in heaven.</p>

<p>“It must be a great consolation to the relatives and
friends of our gallant soldiers to know that they are attended
on their beds of pain and suffering by such nurses.
Wherever a Sister moves she has the prayers and blessings
of the poor soldier, and the thanks and gratitude of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
the officers. Beside whatever bed death has laid his hand,
there is seen a Sister seeking to alleviate the suffering
of the patient and to prepare the parting soul for the judgment
so soon to be pronounced upon it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The following reference to the Holy Cross Sisters
from the pen of Father Corby is apropos:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Sixty Sisters of the Holy Cross went out under Mother
Angela. These Sisters volunteered their services to
nurse the sick and the wounded soldiers, hundreds of whom,
moved to sentiments of purest piety by the words and example
of these angel nurses, begged to be baptized in articulo
mortis&mdash;at the point of death. The labors and self-sacrifice
of the Sisters during the war need no praise here.
The praise is on the lips of every surviving soldier who experienced
their kind and careful ministration. Many a
soldier now looks down from on high with complacency on
the worthy Sisters who were instrumental in saving the
soul when life could not be saved. Nor was it alone from
the Order of the Sisters of the Holy Cross that Sister
nurses engaged in the care of the sick and wounded soldiers.
Many other orders made costly sacrifices to save
life and to save souls, notably the noble Order of the Sisters
of Charity. To members of this order I am personally
indebted. When prostrate with camp fever, insensible for
nearly three days, my life was entrusted to their care.
Like guardian angels these Daughters of St. Vincent
watched every symptom of the fever, and by their skill and
care I was soon able to return to my post of duty.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p></blockquote>

<p>One of the interesting features of the charitable work
of the war came to the notice of Mother Angela in the early
part of 1864. It was a donation of $1000 from Pope Pius
the IX for the relief of the sick and wounded soldiers.
Through Cardinal Barnabo the Pope expressed to Bishop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
Timon, of Buffalo, his tender sympathy for the sufferings
of the many wounded, and requested the Bishop to give,
in the Pope’s name, $500 to aid in alleviating the suffering
of the wounded soldiers in the Northern army, and the
same amount for the same object for the Southern soldiers.
Bishop Timon gave $500 to Mrs. Horatio Seymour,
president of the Sanitary Commission, to aid our wounded
soldiers, and $500 to Miss D. L. Dix, to be applied in
procuring for wounded Southern prisoners in the hospitals
any additional comforts which might be deemed
useful.</p>

<p>The following incident concerning Mother Angela’s
war experiences is from the pen of Eliza Allen Starr:</p>

<p>During the early days of the war and the hospital service
we all know how inadequate were the supplies for the
sick and wounded; how meagre the equipments for the
hospital nurses. A poor, little circular stovepipe served
the indefatigable Mother Angela on which to prepare with
her own skillful hands the early cup of gruel for her patients,
rising as four, or, if need were, at three in the morning
to answer the first call of the sufferers; and the character
of the stores provided was such as few could realize
one year later. At this time the Commissary Board sent
a visitor to the camp and hospital where Mother Angela
and her Sisters were stationed. During all these months
nothing could exceed the courtesy of the officers, who always
shared any choice provisions which came to them
with the Sisters, as they supposed, while the Sisters as
scrupulously passed on to their patients everything which
could tempt the sick appetite, sharing, in fact, only the
rations served regularly to the hospital wards. When the
Commissary visitor arrived he was duly escorted to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
hospital, which excited his warmest approbation for its
order, neatness, comfort of every sort; but as he was bowing
himself out in the most complimentary manner from
the presence of Mother Angela and her band of Sisters,
she said to him: “But, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, you must allow us to
show you some hospitality. Pardon our lack of silver and
porcelain, but take a cup of hospital tea!” “Thank you,
thank you, Mother Angela, but I have taken dinner already
with the officers, and need nothing.” “Allow me to
insist!” and before another excuse could be urged a Sister
appeared with a snow-white napkin and the tincup
and spoon of the hospital and&mdash;the anything than fragrant
beverage of hospital tea. “Sugar, Sister,” said the sweetly-ringing
voice of the gentlewoman, Mother Angela, and before
our Commissary visitor could wave off this fresh specimen
of hospital luxury, Mother Angela had dumped into
the tin cup what resembled the scrapings of the molasses
barrel more than sugar. Our Commissary visitor was a
gentleman from the toe of his boot to the crown of his
head, and he drank the cup of tea, well stirred, to its dregs,
without a grimace, bowing as he handed the empty tincup
to the Sister, while Mother Angela rubbed her little hands
with unmistakable glee, and the full merriment of laughing
eyes, as she said: “I knew, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, you would wish
to taste of our hospital tea!” And the Commissary visitor
vowed in his heart as he turned from the hospital door
that the next train, on his arrival home, should take, as he
said in his letter to Mother Angela, such stores to her
own and to every hospital under his charge as a Christian
man could accept without shame from the hand of any hospital
nurse in the land.</p>

<p>There was another Sister Angela who was prominent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
during the civil war, but who was not so conspicuous as
her illustrious namesake. She is thus referred to in a
recent work:<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>“Sister Angela became a member of the Community
(Visitation Sisters) about 1819. She was one of those characters
who convey to the mind the image of a soul of spotless
innocence. She celebrated her golden jubilee and
lived for several years afterwards, retained to the last her
full mental faculties and childlike simplicity. She was made
Superioress of the foundation in Philadelphia. On the
breaking up of the house there she was recalled to Georgetown.
Then for twelve years at different times she
served as Superioress of Georgetown Convent and governed
with a gentle firmness and a lovely spirit of forebearance;
enduring the many trials incidental to authority
with the utmost patience.</p>

<p>“During the civil war her energy and wisdom shone
forth especially. She was at that time most generous in
trying to aid poor chaplains, and she showed a true zeal
for souls in the advice she gave to soldiers who applied to
her for help. Her charity was remembered, as the nuns
of Georgetown had reason to realize not long ago, during
the encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic, when
one of the veterans called to see “Sister Angela,” not knowing
she had been dead several years. The veteran gave
as his reason for desiring to see her that the angelic Superioress
had converted him. Whenever worn out with
marching and laden with dust, regiments halted in front
of the Convent during the war, a liberal lunch was served
to the weary soldiers, and objects of piety sent out to those
who wanted them by Sister Angela.”

<span class="large">MOTHER ANGELA.</span></h2>

<p class="hang">Related to many eminent men of the century; her tranquil death in the convent
in Indiana; her ability as a writer and an educator. An incident of
the war told by her in a powerful and dramatic style. The original of a
Holy Cross Sister portrayed in a poem.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i_282" src="images/i_282.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Mother Angela, who performed
such valiant service as the head of
the Holy Cross Sisters, departed this
life on March 4, 1887. Her death
was so calm and peaceful that it
seemed as though she were gliding
into slumber rather than passing
from life into eternity. “Mother
Mary of St. Angela” was the name
of this devoted woman, who was previously known to
the world as Eliza Maria Gillespie.</p>

<p>As stated in the preceding chapter Mother Angela
was of distinguished lineage. Her godfather, the elder
Thomas Ewing, was one of the great Whigs and Secretary
of State under President William Henry Harrison. James
Gillespie Blaine, her first cousin, was the idol of his party,
member of Congress, United State Senator, Secretary of
State, and the Republican candidate for the Presidency.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
General William T. Sherman, another relative, ranked
second only to Grant among the Union generals in the civil
war. Phil. B. Ewing, her brother-in-law, won the reputation
of an eminent jurist in Ohio. “Young Tom” Ewing distinguished
himself in the Union army. Her only brother,
Rev. N. H. Gillespie, was the first graduate of Notre Dame
University, and afterwards became its vice president and
editor of the “Ave Maria.”</p>

<p>Mother Angela was born in West Brownsville, Pa.,
February 21, 1824. Her parents lived in a large stone
house. It was a double structure, and in the other
half of it lived her uncle and aunt, the parents of James
G. Blaine, who was born there six years later. Mr. Blaine’s
mother and Mother Angela’s father were brother and sister,
and the two children were reared together until the
one was twelve and the other was six years of age. This
childish association caused a sincere attachment, which
lasted through life.</p>

<p>While receiving her education in the Academy of the
Visitation at Washington the future Sister had many opportunities
for mingling in fashionable Washington society.
One of her chroniclers of that time says that she
had the same personal magnetism that distinguished her
relative, Mr. Blaine. At the age of twenty-seven, however,
she abandoned the world, and after the usual preparation
became a Sister of the Holy Cross. Her work during the
war has already been outlined.</p>

<p>The death of Mother Angela came as a shock to those
with whom she had been associated. She had been ill for
a month, but all looked forward with confidence to her ultimate
recovery. The Father General coincided with the
physician in assigning the sad event to heart disease, probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
brought on, as he says, “by the death of Sister M.
Loba, whom she loved tenderly, and whose funeral procession
passed under her window four hours before.”</p>

<p>The funeral of Mother Angela took place at Notre Dame
on Sunday morning, March 6, 1887, the mortal remains
being borne from the halls where she had been Superior
for thirty-four years.</p>

<p>Telegrams and letters of regret came from all sections
of the country, and even from parts of Europe. Among the
telegrams was the following from one of the kinsmen of
the dead Sister:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
Augusta, Maine, March 4, 1887.<br />
</p>

<p>John G. Ewing:</p>

<p>Your message is a sad one to me. Communicate my
deepest sympathy to Aunt Mary and to your mother.</p>

<p class="author">
JAMES G. BLAINE.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The relatives of the deceased religious who were present
were: Her aged mother, Mrs. M. M. Phelan; her sister,
Mrs. P. B. Ewing; Hon. P. B. Ewing, Lancaster, Ohio; Sr.
Mary Agnes, Miss Mary R. Ewing, Miss Philomene Ewing,
Mr. John G. Ewing, Mrs. N. H. Ewing, Edward S. Ewing,
Mrs. Colonel Steele, Miss Marie Steele, Miss Florence
Steele, Charles Steele, Master Sherman Steele, Mrs. John
Blaine, Miss Louise Blaine, Miss Ella Blaine, Messrs. Walker
and Emmons Blaine. Among the numerous friends in
attendance at the funeral were Justice Daniel Scully, Colonel
W. P. Rend, Mr. and Mrs. P. Cavanagh, Mr. and Mrs.
Alexander Sullivan, Miss Angela Dillon, Miss Eddy, Chicago;
Mr. Jacob Wile, Mr. F. Wile, Mr. George Beale, La Porte,

Toledo, Ohio; Mrs. L. Gregori, Miss F. Gregori, Professor
James J. Edwards, Professor W. Hoynes, Notre Dame, Ind.;
Mrs. Claffey, Notre Dame. Solemn Requiem Mass was
sung by Rev. Father L’Etourneau, assisted by the Rev.
Fathers Spillard and Zahm as deacon and subdeacon; Rev.
Father Regan, acting as master of ceremonies. There were
present in the sanctuary: Rt. Rev. Bishop Gilmour, D. D.;
Very Rev. Father General Sorin, Very Rev. Father Granger,
Very Rev. Father Kilroy, D. D.; Very Rev. Father Corby;
Rev. Fathers Walsh, O’Connell, Hudson, Shortis and
Saulnier.</p>

<p>The late Rt. Rev. Bishop Gilmour preached the funeral
sermon, in which he outlined the life of a model religious.
He said, among other things:</p>

<p>“It is too much to say that she around whose bier we
are gathered to-day is a fair and generous example of
what I have outlined so very imperfectly and so succinctly.
Fair in her talents and her ambitions with what the world
values most, she buries herself&mdash;where? In the silence of
a religious life, in a corner, in an unseen position! When
she came here, some thirty-seven years ago, there was to
be found little of that which to-day might, perhaps, attract
one seeking the religious life. She came here to labor,
to struggle, to wrestle with hardships, to concentrate
her exceptional talents and energies upon the one grand
object of her life. She came in all fervor, animated solely
with zeal for religion&mdash;devotion to her cause. And thirty-seven
years of unfailing generosity tell the tale of her life.</p>

<p>“It is difficult to comprehend what has been done in
those thirty-seven years. It is not easy to realize what a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
devotion, an ambition for God such as hers, might do. Unseen,
unnoticed, unobtrusive the generosity; unfailing, unflagging
the devotion with which God has been served and
man has been blessed&mdash;such is the life of her who lies before
us. We see the results of her labors, not merely in
the material building she has erected, for that, in itself, is
little, but in the moral seed that she has deeply planted
here; that has been the salvation of many who have already
gone to their reward. And amongst those who are
living, how many there are whom she has moulded, attracted,
inspired with high and religious ambitions; whom
she has directed in the paths of life!</p>

<p>“How many through her influence have been brought
back to God and made generous once more! She has lifted
up the weak, and made stronger those who were strong;
soothed the wounded, directed all to nobler and higher aims.
It would be difficult to find a heart so entirely throbbing
for God as hers; a foot so restless and untiring in doing
good as hers; a brain so busy in devising works for the
welfare of religion and her fellow-men. It is difficult for
those who have not known her to realize the extent of her
labors. It is not every person who can comprehend the
depth of Mother Angela’s devotion to the cause of God.
Many have seen it but few have understood it....
For many a long, long day this community will feel the
gap that is made to-day by the loss of one who lies in that
narrow, little coffin.... The kind Father General,
in the days that are coming, will find how much he has
lost in the generous, assisting hand now cold in death....
And you, young friends, will feel the loss of a tender
and directing parent.... It is for us all to pray
that God may bless her, as I am convinced He has.”

<p>After the Bishop’s sermon the final absolution of
the body was given and then the procession marched to
the modest little cemetery and Mother Angela was laid
to rest within a stone’s throw of where the greater part
of her life work had been performed.</p>

<p>Mother Angela rarely spoke of her services in the
war, and with characteristic modesty and humility frequently
endeavored to give others the credit that belonged
to herself. She was a writer with an unusual grace and
charm of style. One of those who served with her during
the war was Sister Mary Josephine. This devoted Sister
died in 1886, and her death evoked the following dramatic
story from the pen of Mother Angela. It was a true story,
and one of her last contributions to the “Ave Maria.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Sister Josephine was one among the first of the seventy
Sisters of the Holy Cross who, during the late civil war,
served the sick and wounded soldiers in the military hospitals
of Louisville, Paducah, Cairo, Mound City, Memphis
and Washington city.</p>

<p>“Those who knew this quiet, gentle religious only during
the last twenty years of her life could scarcely realize
what courage, even heroism, animated her during those
years of the war spent in the hospitals. We give below
one instance among many others.</p>

<p>“In the summer of 1862 the Confederate Fort Charles,
on White River, was attacked on land by a force under
the command of Colonel Fitch, of Indiana, and from the
water by gunboats commanded by Commodore Davis. In
the midst of the battle the boilers of one of the gunboats
exploded, frightfully scalding Captain Kelty and some fifty
others. The sufferers, in their agony, leaped into the river,
and as they did so a broadside from Fort Charles poured
bullets and grapeshot into their parboiled flesh.</p>

<p>“The battle ended with the capture of the fort, and
the wounded of both sides were taken to Mound City Hospital&mdash;a
block of some twenty-four unfinished warehouses
and storerooms, that had been converted into a vast hospital&mdash;in
which, after some of the great battles in the Mississippi
Valley, as many as two thousand patients were
treated by a staff of medical officers, and nursed by twenty-eight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
Sisters, Sister Josephine being one of them. Colonel
Fry, commander of the fort, supposed to be dangerously
wounded, and Captain Kelty were of the number brought
to Mound City after the surrender of Fort Charles.</p>

<p>“The latter was a universal favorite of all the men
and officers of the Western flotilla. His sad state&mdash;the
scalded flesh falling from the bones, and pierced with bullets&mdash;excited
them almost to frenzy. He was tenderly
placed in a little cottage away from the main building, and
Colonel Fry, with a few other sufferers, was put in a front
room in the second story of the hospital, under the immediate
care of Sister Josephine.</p>

<p>“The next day the report spread like wildfire through
the hospital, and among the one hundred soldiers detailed
to guard it, that Captain Kelty was dying. The wildest excitement
prevailed, and in the frenzy of the moment Colonel
Fry was denounced as his murderer; it was declared
that he had given the inhuman order to fire on the scalded
men. Everyone firmly believed this. But it was not true.
Colonel Fry was ignorant of the explosion when the order
was given.</p>

<p>“Sister Josephine, very pale, yet wonderfully composed,
went to the Sister in charge of the hospital to say
that all the wounded had just been removed from the room
under her care except Colonel Fry. The soldiers detailed
to guard the hospital, and the gunboat men, had built a
rough scaffold in front of the two windows of the room,
mounted it, with loaded guns, and loudly declared that
they would stay there, and the moment they heard of Captain
Kelty’s death they would shoot Colonel Fry. ‘And,’
continued Sister Josephine, ‘the doctor made me leave
the room, saying that my life was in danger. He took the
key from the door and gave it to “Dutch Johnny,” telling
him that he had entire charge of the man within.’</p>

<p>“Now, ‘Dutch Johnny’ was one of six brothers; five
had been killed at Belmont; Johnny was so badly wounded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
and crippled in the same battle that he was useless for
active service, and so left to help in the hospital. But one
idea possessed him; in revenge for his brothers’ death he
intended to kill five Confederates before he died.</p>

<p>“In this fearful state of affairs the Sister in charge
went to the Surgeon General of the staff, begging him to
see that no murder be committed. Dr. Franklin answered
that he was powerless to control events, and that the captain
of the company guarding the hospital was absent.</p>

<p>“‘Then,’ said the Sister, ‘I must call my twenty-seven
Sisters from the sick; we will leave the hospital, and walk
to Cairo.’ (A distance of three miles.)</p>

<p>“In vain did the doctor represent to her the sad state
of all the patients she was leaving; she would not consent
to remain in a house where murder would soon be committed;
except on one condition: that the doctor would give her
the key of Colonel Fry’s room, and that the Sisters have
the care and entire control of the patient.</p>

<p>“‘But,’ expostulated the doctor, ‘it will be at the risk
of your lives; for if Captain Kelty dies&mdash;and I see no hopes
of his recovery&mdash;no power on earth can restrain those men
from shooting Colonel Fry.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, doctor!’ she answered, ‘I have too much faith in
the natural chivalry of every soldier&mdash;be he from North
or South of Mason and Dixon’s line&mdash;to fear he would shoot
a poor, wounded man while a Sister stood near him!’</p>

<p>“Seeing the Sisters would leave if this request was
not granted, the doctor sent for ‘Dutch Johnny,’ took the
key from him and gave it to the Sister. The latter called
for Sister Josephine, and both went in haste to the room
of the wounded man.</p>

<p>“As they turned the key and opened the door a fearful
scene was before them. Colonel Fry lay in a cot: his arms,
both broken, were strapped up with cords fastened to the
ceiling; one broken leg was strapped to the bed; only his
head seemed free. As he turned it, and glared fiercely,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
as he thought, upon another foe, he seemed like some wild
animal at bay and goaded to madness. Before Sister Josephine
had been forced to leave the room she had closed
the windows and lowered the blinds; but her successor,
‘Dutch Johnny,’ had changed all this; he had rolled up the
blinds, and threw up the lower sashes. And there, on the
raised platform, not fifty feet from him, Colonel Fry could
see the faces and hear the voices of the soldiers and gunboat
men, shouting every few minutes for him to be ready
to die, for they would shoot him as soon as they heard of
Captain Kelty’s death.</p>

<p>“Very quickly and gently did Sister Josephine speak
to the wounded man, moistening his parched lips with a
cooling drink, giving what relief she could to the poor, tortured
body, and assuring him that she and the other Sister
would not leave him; so he need not fear that the soldiers
would fire while they remained.</p>

<p>“When these men saw the Sisters in the room they
begged them to leave, even threatened, but to no purpose;
brave, noble Sister Josephine and her companion
stood at their post all through that long afternoon,
and far into the night; and they prayed, perhaps more
earnestly than they ever prayed before, that Captain Kelty
would not die; for, in spite of all their assuring words to
Colonel Fry, they did not feel so very certain that their
lives would be safe among frenzied men, bent on their taking
revenge into their own hands.</p>

<p>“In the meantime it became known that Captain Kelty
was a Catholic&mdash;a convert&mdash;though for many years he
had neglected his religious duties. A messenger was sent
to Cairo to bring Father Welsh to the dying man. When
he came Captain Kelty was in delirium, and the Father
could give him only Extreme Unction. Soon after, about
9 o’clock, he sank into a quiet sleep. He awoke, perfectly
conscious, near midnight, made his confession, received
Holy Communion, and took some nourishment. The doctor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
said all danger was over, and a messenger ran in
breathless haste to spread the glad tidings. The excited
soldiers fired a few blank cartridges as a parting salvo,
jumped from the scaffold, and were seen no more. The
rest of the night good Sister Josephine took care of her
patient, undisturbed by any serious fear that both might
be sent into eternity before morning.</p>

<p>“When the naval officers, who the night before had
looked, as they feared, their last look on the living face of
Captain Kelty, went up the next day from Cairo and found
him out of danger, they laughed and cried with joy. In a
whisper Captain Kelty asked them to be silent for a moment
and listen to him. In a voice trembling with weakness
he said:</p>

<p>“‘While I thank these good doctors for all they have
done, I must testify&mdash;and they will bear me out in what I
say&mdash;it was not their skill nor any earthly power that
brought me back from the brink of the grave, but the saving
and life-giving Sacraments of the Catholic Church.’</p>

<p>“Colonel Fry and Captain Kelty had long known each
other. Both were naval officers, until at the beginning of
the war Captain Fry left the service, and was made Colonel
Fry in the Confederate Army.</p>

<p>“As soon as Captain Kelty was well enough to learn
what had passed, he declared Colonel Fry was guiltless of
the barbarity of which he had been accused. And Sister
Josephine was made the bearer to her patient of all
the delicacies sent to Captain Kelty, and which he insisted
on sharing with Colonel Fry.</p>

<p>“As soon as Captain Kelty could travel he was taken
to his home in Baltimore. For his bravery he was made
Commodore, and placed in command at Norfolk; but he
was maimed for life; his right hand and arm, all shriveled
and wasted, hung lifeless by his side. When able to take
such a journey alone, he went all the way back to Cairo
to see again and thank those Sisters, who, he said, under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
God, had saved his life in a double sense. He remained
until his death a most fervent Catholic.</p>

<p>“Colonel Fry, after many months of suffering, also recovered;
he was paroled, and returned to his home in New
Orleans. There he became a Catholic, often declaring that
good Sister Josephine’s bravery and devotedness during
that day and night of torture and agony, followed by
months of long suffering, were eloquent sermons that he
could not resist.</p>

<p>“A few years after the close of the war he was one
of the leaders of that rash band of adventurers who invaded
Cuba. His fate is well known; with those under his
command he was captured and executed. But it is not
so well known that he profited by the days spent in prison,
in instructing those with him; and many were converted
to the holy faith that first came to him through Sister
Josephine.</p>

<p>“Twenty-three years to the very month passed away,
when quietly and calmly, as in the discharge of hospital
duties, this good Sister, strengthened by the Sacraments
of the Church, literally fell asleep in Our Lord, a few days
after the close of the annual retreat, at which she had
assisted. Owing to the intense heat of the weather, it
was deemed necessary to advance the hour of burial from
6 o’clock in the morning to 8 o’clock on the previous evening.
Scarce ever was a procession so affecting; the Sisters&mdash;more
than three hundred in number&mdash;all bearing lighted
tapers, the Rev. Chaplains, and the venerable Father Sorin,
Superior General, C. S. C., followed the remains of Sister
Josephine through the beautiful grounds of St. Mary’s
to the cemetery. The moon shone as brightly on her lifeless
body as it had shone years ago through the open window
on her brave, gentle form, when she saved from
death or insanity the wounded prisoner.</p>

<p>“Of the four persons most interested in that night of
agony and torture in the vast military hospital on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
banks of the Ohio, but one now remains&mdash;Sister Josephine’s
companion. May the three gone to eternity remember
her before God.”</p>

<p>The sole survivor of that dreadful episode and the
historian of the event has also gone to her reward. The
prayers of innumerable persons that have benefited by
her charity and goodness ascend to the skies, coupled
with the hope that Mother Angela will not forget those
she has left behind.</p></blockquote>

<span class="large">NON-CATHOLIC TRIBUTES.</span></h2>

<p class="hang">Comment of Mary A. Livermore upon the work of Mother Angela at Mound
City: “The world has known no nobler and more heroic women than
those found in the ranks of the Catholic Sisterhoods.” A famous scout
gives his impressions of the Sisters. Susan D. Messinger tells of the
work of the Sisters at New Berne, N. C.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i_297" src="images/i_297.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>No tributes that have been paid to the work of the
Catholic Sisterhoods during the war have been more cordial
or more emphatic than those coming from non-Catholic
sources. It is a significant
fact that those most prejudiced
against the Sisters have been
persons who knew the least
about them, while the warmest
friends of the dark-robed messengers
of charity and peace
have been persons who came in
contact with them and their labors for humanity.</p>

<p>Mary A. Livermore, whose personal services during
the war were by no means inconsiderable, is one non-Catholic
writer who does not hesitate to give the Catholic Sister
full credit for what she did. Miss Livermore says the
Mound City Hospital, in charge of the Sisters of the Holy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
Cross, was considered the best military hospital in the
United States. She writes:<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>“There was one general hospital in Cairo, called by
the people ‘the Brick Hospital.’ Here the Sisters of the
Holy Cross were employed as nurses, one or more to each
ward. Here were order, cleanliness and good nursing. The
food was cooked in a kitchen outside of the hospital. Surgeons
were detailed to every ward and visited their patients
twice a day, and oftener if necessary. The apothecaries’
room was supplied with an ample store of medicines
and surgical appliances, and the store-rooms possessed
an abundance of clothing and delicacies for the
sick.”</p>

<p>The work done at Mound City is thus graphically set
forth: “Except in Mound City everything was in a chaotic
condition compared with the complete arrangement afterwards.
The hospital at Mound City occupied a block of
brick stores, built before the war to accommodate the
prospective commerce of the war. They had not been occupied,
and as the blockade of the Mississippi rendered it
uncertain when they would be needed for their legitimate
use, they were turned over to the medical department for
hospital use. At the time of my visit the Mound City hospital
was considered the best military hospital in the
United States. This was due to the administrative talent
of Dr. E. S. Franklin, of Dubuque, Ia., who, despite poverty
of means and material, transformed the rough block of
stores into a superb hospital, accommodating 1000 patients.
Fifteen hundred had been crowded in it by dint of close
packing.</p>

<p>“The most thorough system was maintained in every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
department. There was an exact time and place for everything.
Every person was assigned to a particular work
and held responsible for its performance. If anyone
proved a shirk, incompetent or insubordinate, he was
sent off in the next boat. A Shaker-like cleanliness and
sweetness of atmosphere pervaded the various wards; the
sheets and pillows were of immaculate whiteness and the
patients who were convalescent were cheerful and contented.
The Sisters of the Holy Cross were employed as
nurses, and by their skill, quietness, gentleness and tenderness
were invaluable in the sick wards. Every patient
gave hearty testimony to the skill and kindness of the
Sisters.</p>

<p>“Mother Angela was the Superior of the Sisters&mdash;a
gifted lady of rare cultivation and executive ability with
winning sweetness of manner. She was a member of the
Ewing family and a cousin of Mr. and Mrs. General Sherman.
The Sisters had nearly broken up their famous
schools at South Bend to answer the demand for nurses.
If I had ever felt prejudiced against these Sisters as
nurses, my experience with them during the war would
have dissipated it entirely. The world has known no nobler
and more heroic women than those found in the ranks
of the Catholic Sisterhoods.”</p>

<p>Captain “Jack” Crawford, who became famous as a
scout in the Union army, in the course of a lecture delivered
after the war speaks of the Sisters as follows:</p>

<p>“On all God’s green and beautiful earth there are no
purer, no nobler, no more kind-hearted and self-sacrificing
women than those who wear the sombre garb of Catholic
Sisters. During the war I had many opportunities for observing
their noble and heroic work, not only in the camp
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
and hospital, but on the death-swept field of battle. Right
in the fiery front of dreadful war, where bullets hissed in
maddening glee, and shot and shell flew madly by with demoniac
shrieks, where dead and mangled forms lay with
pale, blood-flecked faces, yet wear the scowl of battle, I
have seen the black-robed Sisters moving over the field,
their solicitous faces wet with the tears of sympathy, administering
to the wants of the wounded and whispering
words of comfort into the ears soon to be deafened by the
cold, implacable hand of death. Now kneeling on the blood-bespattered
sod to moisten with water the bloodless lips
on which the icy kiss of the death angel has left its pale
imprint; now breathing words of hope of an immortality
beyond the grave into the ear of some mangled hero, whose
last shots in our glorious cause had been fired but a moment
before; now holding the crucifix to receive the last
kiss from somebody’s darling boy, from whose breast the
life blood was splashing and who had offered his life as a
willing sacrifice on the altar of his country; now with tender
touch and tear-dimmed eye binding gaping wounds,
from which most women must have shrunk in horror; now
scraping together a pillow of forest leaves, upon which
some pain-racked head might rest until the spirit took its
flight to other realms&mdash;brave, fearless of danger, trusting
implicitly in the Master whose overshadowing eye was
noting their every movement; standing as shielding, prayerful
angels between the dying soldiers and the horrors of
death. Their only recompense the sweet, soul-soothing
consciousness that they were doing their duty; their only
hope of reward that peace and eternal happiness which
awaited them beyond the star-emblazoned battlements
above. Oh! my friends, it was a noble work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p>“How many a veteran of the war, who wore the Blue
or the Gray, can yet recall the soothing touch of a Sister’s
hand as he lay upon the pain-tossed couch of a hospital!
Can we ever forget their sympathetic-eyes, their low, soft-spoken
words of encouragement and cheer when the result
of the struggle between life and death yet hung in the balance?
Oh! how often have I followed the form of that
good Sister Valencia with my sunken eyes as she moved
away from my cot to the cot of another sufferer and have
breathed from the most sacred depths of my faintly-beating
heart the fervent prayer: ‘God bless her! God bless
her!’</p>

<p>“My friends, I am not a Catholic, but I stand ready
at any and all times to defend these noble women, even
with my life, for I owe that life to them.”</p>

<p>Miss Susan D. Messinger, of Roxbury, Mass., writes
the following eloquent letter to the author:</p>

<p>“It is with real pleasure I pay my tribute to that noble
band of Sisters of Mercy, who did such a Christian work
of love and helpfulness for our suffering soldier boys in
New Berne, N. C. My brother, Captain (afterwards Colonel)
Messinger, was on the staff of Major General John G. Foster,
Eighteenth Army Corps, stationed at New Berne, N. C.
After the taking of New Berne my brother was made Provost
Marshal and given quarters near the general at the
request of Mrs. Foster, my sister. Mrs. Messinger and I
were sent for to stay a few weeks, although in no official
capacity. No woman could be in the army without finding
much she could do to relieve and comfort, and especially
through the home our little quarters became to all, from
major generals to privates. We could not go home. We
stayed until summer. I write all this personal matter to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
show how I was thrown into the companionship of these
Catholic Sisters. Although my brother and myself were
Unitarians we became close, congenial friends with these
brave women, who had to seek constantly advice and help
from my brother on account of his position as Provost
Marshal.</p>

<p>“General Foster was a Catholic and brought to New
Berne six Sisters from the Convent of Mercy, in New York,
to take charge of a hospital in New Berne for special cases.
He took for their convent a house which had been General
Burnsides’ headquarters, and which also, during the war
of the Revolution, had been occupied by Washington, his
room and writing table sacredly preserved. This house
communicated by a plank walk with another house, or
houses, used as hospitals, and only over that plank walk did
those devoted women ever take any exercise or recreation.
They literally gave themselves as nurses to the poor,
wounded, maimed and sick soldiers brought to them day
after day. And most beautifully did they fulfill the
charge. Many a soldier will never forget their tender, unselfish
care and devotion. I was witness myself to much
of it, as I was privileged to go from ward to ward. Many a
dying man blessed them as angels of mercy, almost looking
upon them as sent from the other world.</p>

<p>“One dear young fellow, who was almost reverenced
by doctors and nurses for his patience and fortitude (young
George Brooks, brother to the late Bishop Philipps Brooks),
looked up into the sweet face of Mother Augustine, as she
bent over to minister or to soothe the dear boy, with:
‘Mother, thank you, Mother,’ and with such an ineffable
smile of peace. We could never tell if in his delirium he
thought it was his own mother, but the peace on the boy’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
face showed what his nurse had been to him. His sickness
was short and death came just before the father reached
New Berne.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_303" src="images/i_303.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FARRAGUT IN THE RIGGING.</p></div>

<p>“One dear young friend of mine, Sergeant Charles
Hinkling, was sick under their care many weeks; finally
brought home to linger and die; but he and his family
were most deeply grateful to the kind Sisters for the tender
care bestowed upon him in their hospital, especially by
Sister Gertrude.</p>

<p>“Sister Mary Gertrude is now the Mother Superior of
an institution in California, after a life of hard work
among the poor and suffering. I think she is perhaps the
only one living of those dear women I knew in New Berne.</p>

<p>“It was through the winter of 1862-63 that the Sisters
were in New Berne. The next year the headquarters
were removed to Fortress Monroe and the Sisters returned
to New York.</p>

<p>“Through these thirty years or more&mdash;my brother
and many, many more who could have borne evidence
to the faithful work of the Sisters of Mercy in New
Berne&mdash;have answered the roll call to the
Home above. But those days stand out in
my memory as clearly as if yesterday, with all the pain,
anxiety, hope, fear and faith, and no scenes are more real
to me than those hours with those devoted women who
were helping God’s children so wisely, so gently, with no
thought of reward or glory! God bless their memories to
us all.”</p>

<p>General David McMurtrie Gregg ranks as one of the
most distinguished cavalry officers that served in the
Union Army. No man on either side had a more brilliant
record for discretion in camp and bravery in battle. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
graduated at West Point, and after meritorious service in
the regular army in New Mexico, California, Oregon and
Washington Territory he became colonel of the Eighth
Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry. He served with his regiment
during the entire Peninsular campaign of 1862, and
in November of that year he became brigadier general of
volunteers. He was placed in command of a division of
cavalry on the battlefield of Fredericksburg and served as
its commander in the Stoneman’s raid, in the campaigns of
Gettysburg, Mine Run, the Wilderness and in front of Petersburg.
He commanded the cavalry of the Army of the
Potomac from August, 1864, until his resignation from
the army, in February, 1865. He was breveted major general
United States volunteers, August 1, 1864. General
Gregg has occupied many positions of distinction in civil
life.</p>

<p>The writer of this volume recently communicated with
General Gregg regarding his experiences with the Catholic
Sisterhoods in the war, and received the following very
interesting reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“My Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your letter of the
8th instant, inclosing an article taking from a newspaper
published in 1866, and in which the name ‘General Gregg’
is mentioned. The person referred to was my cousin, General
John I. Gregg, who commanded one of my brigades.</p>

<p>“I do not recall that at any time in the field I was
brought in contact with representatives of any of the Catholic
Sisterhoods, yet the mere mention of the matter makes
me reminiscent, and whilst my experience with a representative
of a Sisterhood was purely personal, it was so
pleasant and profitable to me that I cannot refrain from
mentioning it. In the summer of 1861 I was made a captain
in the Sixth Regular Cavalry, and was ordered East
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
from Oregon, where for several years I had been serving
as a lieutenant in the First Dragoons. In crossing the
Isthmus of Panama I contracted the low fever of that
region.</p>

<p>“In September I joined the Sixth at Bladensburg, near
Washington, and after a short time I was prostrated by
this fever. Just at this time the regiment was ordered
away, and I was left in the camp seriously ill. Stretched
on the bottom of an ambulance I was hauled over a rough
road to Washington and placed in a bed in the old Kirkwood
House in a state of delirium. A few hours after Major
Ingalls, who subsequently became Quarter Master General,
a warm personal friend, heard of my condition, and
with another friend came to the hotel with a carriage, and
I was taken to the E Street Infirmary, which was in
charge of a surgeon of the regular army. At the entrance
of the infirmary stood the doctor, and at his side an elderly
Sister of Charity.</p>

<p>“I was carried in and placed in a large room next to the
surgeon’s, and was at once put into a clean, comfortable
bed. The good Sister, who had some superior rank, saw
that I was made comfortable, and, it is needless to say, that
after what I had gone through, I felt as though I were in
heaven. Then followed weeks of severe illness with typhoid
fever. I had the attendance of my own man, and
had many visits each day from doctors, stewards and their
assistants, but the real nursing was done by another Sister
of Charity, Sister Margaret.</p>

<p>“I have never forgotten her gentleness and cheerfulness.
She was simply the highest type of a Christian woman.
Her good nursing continued for weeks, and I was
kept alive only to go through another trying experience,
for an a cold and rainy night early in November, and nearly
midnight, this infirmary took fire and was entirely destroyed.
How I escaped has nothing to do with this narrative,
but to my exceeding regret I never again saw Sister
Margaret.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>

<p>“But I have never forgotten her, and when in the
street I meet one of the Sisterhood to which she belonged
there is in my heart a feeling of respect and gratitude to
those self-denying and devoted women who are spending
their lives in doing good to their fellow-beings.</p>

<p>“I have written more than I intended, but I love to
talk about the good Sister Margaret, and it is not surprising
that if, as now, I am inclined to write about her, I allow
my pen to run away a little.</p>

<p>The South Bend Tribune, shortly after the return of
the Sisters of the Holy Cross to their convent homes, printed
the following:</p>

<p>“When in September, 1861, General Lew Wallace,
commanding the Federal forces in Southern Kentucky,
applied to St. Mary’s for nurses, Mother Angela, with five
other Sisters, hastened to the relief of the suffering soldiers
at the camp in Paducah. And before the opening of
the year 1862 seventy-five Sisters were sent from St.
Mary’s, and her branch houses, to the military hospitals
at Louisville, Paducah, Cairo, Mound City, Memphis and
Washington.</p>

<p>“Of this number, two died from fever, caught in the
discharge of their duties. When the Western flotilla of
gunboats opened the Mississippi River Commodore Davis
asked and obtained the services of seven Sisters of the
Holy Cross to take charge of the floating hospital, in
which hundreds of lives were saved. These deeds were not
done for the world’s praise; they were the duties to which
the lives of the Sisters of the Holy Cross are devoted, whenever
suffering humanity requires their help. A memorial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
of those days now rests in St. Mary’s grounds, in the shape
of two immense shattered cannon, captured at Island No.
10, and presented to Mother Angela by the commander of
the flotilla. These cannon are destined to be moulded into
a statue of ‘Our Lady of Peace,’ and will remain in St.
Mary’s grounds as an historical monument of the dark
days of our civil war.”</p>

<p>A correspondent of the (Protestant) Church Journal,
writing from New Orleans in 1862, highly compliments the
Sisters of Charity in that city for the amount of good they
are unostentatiously doing, saying among other things:</p>

<p>“One misses here a church hospital. Many of our Federal
officers and men are cared for when sick in the Roman
Catholic institutions, the Hotel Dieu and the Charity
Hospital. The Sisters attend most winningly on their patients
and force them to confess on recovering that their
own mothers and sisters at home could not have done better
for them. On leaving the patient carries away in his
hand some Roman Catholic book of prayer, or controversy,
or instruction, and in his heart a grateful remembrance of
the fair donor, a resolution to peruse the book, and a profound
conviction that the Roman Catholic Church, with all
its faults, certainly has a soul of true Christian love. Surely
the time will come when all churchmen will acknowledge
the angelic influence of Christian Sisterhoods in the
natural connections between curing the body and renovating
the soul, the imperative necessity of organizing Christian
and accomplished nurses and placing them in institutions
where their love and skill can do the highest possible
service.”</p>

<p>The Charleston Mercury, during the siege of that city,
said:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>“There is probably no one in this city whose eyes
have not followed with interest the quiet and modest figure
of some Sister of Mercy as she passed upon her rounds. It
is in this gentle impersonation of Christian benevolence
and to her associates that our sick and wounded soldiers
owe the tenderest of those ministrations which are better
than medicine in their effect upon the languishing invalid.
Nor is the large kindness of these ladies solely displayed in
the personal cares which they bestow upon the sufferer.
They give generously from their stores at the same time,
and many a want is thus supplied which might otherwise
have been left ungratified. Since the beginning of the
siege of our city their presence has diffused its blessings
in every hospital, and their unwearied attentions to the soldiers
have done incalculable good.”</p>

<p>In the closing year of the war Rev. George W. Pepper,
a Methodist clergyman, in a sermon preached by him in
the Methodist Episcopal Church, White Eyes, Coshocton
County, Ohio, eulogized these heroic ladies as follows:</p>

<p>“The war has brought out one result&mdash;it has shown
that numbers of the weaker sex, though born to wealth
and luxury, are ready to renounce every comfort and brave
every hardship, that they may minister to the suffering,
tend the wounded in their agony, and soothe the last struggles
of the dying. God bless the Sisters of Charity in their
heroic mission! I had almost said their heroic martyrdom!
And I might have said it, for I do think that in walking
those long lines of sick beds, in giving themselves to all
the ghastly duties of the hospital, they are doing a harder
thing than was allotted to many who mounted the scaffold
or dared the stake.”</p>

<p>“Mack,” a correspondent of the Ohio State Journal,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
writing from Murfreesboro, under date of January 4, 1863,
about hospital scenes, which he describes as heartrending,
thus speaks of the kind offices and invaluable services of
the Sisters of Charity:</p>

<p>“It is now a pleasure to turn from this dark and dismal
description of the majority of our hospitals to an oasis&mdash;a
something that is in reality bright and cheering. There
is a sect called Roman Catholics&mdash;a sect that, in my younger
days, I was taught to look upon as monsters, capable
of any crime in the calendar of human frailties&mdash;who have
hospitals in their own charge attended by Sisters of Charity.
They should be called ‘angels,’ who know what true,
disinterested humanity is. I have visited them, therefore
I speak of what I know. Everything in and about them is
clean and comfortable; scarcely a death takes place within
their portals. If a soldier is dangerously sick you will
see by the side of his clean and tidy cot one of these heaven-born
‘angels’ (we call them nothing else), ministering
to his every want with the tender care of a mother or sister.
They glide noiselessly from cot to cot cheering the
despondent and speaking words of kindness to all. No one
who has the heart of a man can help loving them with a
holy sisterly love. There is not a soldier in Richmond but
would beg, if it was possible, that when wounded or sick
he should to be taken to such an hospital, and for myself,
sooner than be taken to any other, I would rather die by
the wayside with God’s canopy my only covering. Would
to God there were more of them!”</p>

<p>The following account of a presentation to a Sister of
Charity is from the Cleveland Herald of November 13,
1865:</p>

<p>“One of the most pleasant presentation affairs we remember
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
to have attended took place at Charity Hospital
yesterday, at 11 o’clock. After Professor Weber, Dr. Scott
and the students had been seated the Lady Superior was
invited into the room and presented with a beautiful engraving,
one of the proof-sheets copied from the painting of
Constant Mayor, entitled ‘Consolation,’ by Captain Samuel
Whiting. Mr. Whiting, in presenting the engraving,
said:</p>

<p>“‘Sister Superior, some years ago, while in command
of one of the New Orleans steamships, I was prostrated
at that port with a severe attack of yellow fever, and
though I had many friends there, had it not been for the
tender care and skillful nursing of the Sisters of Charity,
I have no idea that I should have survived the attack.</p>

<p>“‘During our late fearful and bloody war the devotion
of your noble order to the cause of humanity has won
the admiration of the world, and entirely obliterated the
illiberal prejudices of the most bigoted opponents of your
sect. Certainly, no soldier of the Crimean army will ever
ignore the kind care and gentle nursing of the Sisters of
Charity.’”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each hospital throughout our land could count them by the score<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose deeds have doubly sanctified our long and bloody war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a home-returning brave will long delight to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her, the gentle minister, who tended him so well.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mother calls a blessing down on her who nursed her son,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Last at the dear Redeemer’s Cross and earliest at His grave.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“The citizens of Cleveland may well be congratulated
on the possession of this noble Institution. The rare skill
of its eminent and accomplished surgeons, the sound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
teaching of its learned pathologist, combined with the
tender nursing of your good and benevolent Sisterhood,
will relieve many of the ills that flesh is heir to, and restore
to many a grateful sufferer the God-given priceless
boon of health.</p>

<p>“As a small token of grateful recollections to my
nurses at New Orleans, I beg to present to the Sisters of
Charity Hospital this engraving, one of the proof-sheets,
copied from the beautiful painting of Constant Mayer, entitled
‘Consolation,’ and with it the following poem, which
I take pleasure in writing for them, descriptive of the
scene so admirably portrayed by the accomplished artist:</p>

<p>“It now remains for me only to tender you this humble
testimonial of my regard and my hearty wishes for the
fullest prosperity of the Charity Hospital and College, for
the temporal and eternal welfare of the Sisterhood of the
first, and the continued health and usefulness of the eminent
faculty of the last.”</p>

<p>The remarks of Captain Whiting met with a hearty
response from Dr. Scott, in behalf of the Lady Superior,
in acceptance of the picture.</p>

<p>The Memphis Appeal, in its issue of February 17, 1866,
thus bears testimony to the zeal and value of the Sisters
of Charity in this city:</p>

<p>“Vincent de Paul, who has since received, so
justly deserved, the title of ‘Benefactor of
Mankind,’ was the originator of that divine and charitable
society, ‘The Sisters of Charity,’ in a small town of France,
in the early part of the seventeenth century. The signal
service rendered by them during the past civil war to our
sick, wounded and dying soldiers in camp, in hospital and
on the battlefield, and their unwearied and constant ministrations
to the suffering and poor of all classes throughout
the land, is the theme of praise and commendation on the
lips of all, no matter of what religious creed or faith.</p>

<p>“Their God-like and noble works have won respect, the
most profound from every one. In our own city the result
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
of their exertions are to be seen on every hand. In the
cause of education their stand is pre-eminent. With them
modesty, knowledge and refinement are most carefully
blended. The young girl, after a tutelage of years under
their careful supervision, walks forth into the world, with
a mind as pure and free, and demeanor as gentle and kind,
as when first these precious charges were tendered to their
keeping. And how carefully are the poor little ones, without
parents and bereft of homes, provided for by these
angels of earth!</p>

<p>“The asylum under their charge and guidance, situated
near the Catholic Cemetery, on the outskirts of the city, is
the most complete institution of its kind in the State. A
large number of orphans are educated, clothed and fed
here the year in and out, finding compensation only in the
good they have done and the anticipation of a bright reward
hereafter, from Him ‘Who tempereth the wind to
the shorn lamb,’ and under whose ‘All-seeing Eye’ every
act of charity and faith is always recorded. Their labors
in behalf of the sick are ever attended with the most cheering
results. Take a look at our city hospitals, and you will
find everything well arranged, clean and neat, and bearing
the impress most unmistakably of the goodness of their
hearts and the greatness of their works.</p>

<p>“The patients, one and all, express the most sincere
satisfaction at their treatment, and pray, as all good people
do, that the society which has rendered so much good
to us and all mankind may be like the foundation stone
of all blessings&mdash;Truth&mdash;and with it ever bear the stamp
of immortality.”

<span class="large">A LESSON IN CHARITY.</span></h2>

<p class="hang">An incident of the war in which a gentle Sister of Charity and a stern military
commander played the leading parts. “What do you do with your
beggings?” The Red River campaign and its fatal results. The general
in the hospital. “Did you get the ice and beef?” A grateful
patient and his appreciation of the real worth of the Sisters.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i_315" src="images/i_315.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“During the late war, and when General S. was in command
of the department at New Orleans, the Sisters of
Charity made frequent applications to him for assistance.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
Especially were they desirous
to obtain supplies at what was
termed ‘commissary prices;’ that is,
at a reduction or commutation of
one-third the amount which the same
provisions would cost at market
rates. The principal demand was for ice, flour, beef and
coffee, but mainly ice, a luxury which only the Union forces
could enjoy at anything like a reasonable price. The hospitals
were full of the sick and wounded of both the Federal
and Confederate armies, and the benevolent institutions
of the city were taxed to the utmost in their endeavors
to aid the poor and the suffering, for those were trying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
times, and war has many victims. Foremost among these
Christian workers stood the various Christian Sisterhoods.
These noble women were busy day and night, never seeming
to know fatigue, and overcoming every obstacle that,
in so many discouraging forms, obstructed the way of doing
good&mdash;obstacles which would have completely disheartened
less resolute women, or those not trained in the
school of patience, faith, hope and charity, and where the
first grand lesson learned is self-denial. Of money there
was little, and food, fuel and medicine were scarce and
dear; yet they never faltered, going on in the face of all
difficulties, through poverty, war and unfriendly aspersions,
never turning aside, never complaining, never despairing.
No one will ever know the sublime courage of these
good Sisters during the dark days of the Rebellion. Only
in that hour when the Judge of all mankind shall summon
before Him the living and the dead will they receive their
true reward, the crown everlasting, and the benediction:
‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’</p>

<p>“It was just a week previous to the Red River campaign,
when all was hurry and activity throughout the
Department of the Gulf, that General S., a stern, irascible
old officer of the regular army, sat at his desk in his office
on Julia street, curtly giving orders to subordinates, dispatching
messengers hither and thither to every part of
the city where troops were stationed, and stiffly receiving
such of his command as had important business to transact.</p>

<p>“In the midst of this unusual hurry and preparation
the door noiselessly opened, and a humble Sister of Charity
entered the room. A handsome young lieutenant of the
staff instantly arose and deferentially handed her a chair,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
for those sombre gray garments were respected, if not understood,
even though he had no reverence for the religious
faith which they represented.</p>

<p>“General S. looked up from his writing, angered by
the intrusion of one whose ‘fanaticism’ he despised, and a
frown of annoyance and displeasure gathered darkly on
his brow.</p>

<p>“‘Orderly!’</p>

<p>“The soldier on duty without the door, who had admitted
the Sister, faced about, saluted and stood mute,
awaiting the further command of his chief.</p>

<p>“‘Did I not give orders that no one was to be admitted?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir; but&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘When I say no one, I mean no one,’ thundered the
General.</p>

<p>“The orderly bowed and returned to his post. He was
too wise a soldier to enter into explanation with so irritable
a superior. All this time the patient Sister sat calm
and still, biding the moment when she might speak and
meekly state the object of her mission. The General gave
her the opportunity in the briefest manner possible, and
sharply enough, too, in all conscience.</p>

<p>“‘Well, madam?’</p>

<p>“She raised a pair of sad, dark eyes to his face, and
the gaze was so pure, so saintly, so full of silent pleading,
that the rough old soldier was touched in spite of himself.
Around her fell the heavy muffling dress of her order,
which, however coarse and ungraceful, had something
strangely solemn and mournful about it. Her hands, small
and fair, were clasped almost suppliantly, and half-hidden
in the loose sleeves, as if afraid of their own trembling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
beauty; hands that had touched tenderly, lovingly, so
many death-damp foreheads; that had soothed so much
pain; eyes that had met prayerfully so many dying glances;
lips that had cheered to the mysterious land so many parting
souls, and she was only a Sister of Charity&mdash;only one
of that innumerable band whose good deeds shall live
after them.</p>

<p>“‘We have a household of sick and wounded whom we
must care for in some way, and I came to ask of you the
privilege, which I humbly beseech you will not deny us, of
obtaining ice and beef at commissary prices.’</p>

<p>“The gentle, earnest pleading fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p>“‘Always something,’ snarled the General. ‘Last
week it was flour and ice; to-day it is ice and beef; to-morrow
it will be coffee and ice, I suppose, and all for a lot
of rascally rebels, who ought to be shot, instead of being
nursed back to life and treason.’</p>

<p>“‘General!’&mdash;the Sister was majestic now&mdash;‘Rebel or
Federal, I do not know; Protestant or Catholic, I do not
ask. They are not soldiers when they come to us; they are
simply suffering fellow-creatures. Rich or poor, of gentle
or lowly blood, it is not our province to inquire. Ununiformed,
unarmed, sick and helpless, we ask not on which
side they fought. Our work begins after yours is done.
Yours the carnage, ours the binding up of wounds. Yours
the battle, ours the duty of caring for the mangled left
behind on the field. Ice I want for the sick, the wounded,
the dying. I plead for all, I beg for all, I pray for all God’s
poor suffering creatures, wherever I may find them.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, you can beg, I’ll admit. What do you do with
all your beggings? It is always more, more! never enough!’</p>

<p>“With this, the General resumed his writing, thereby
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
giving the Sister to understand that she was dismissed.
For a moment her eyes fell, her lips trembled&mdash;it was a
cruel taunt. Then the tremulous hands slowly lifted and
folded tightly across her breast, as if to still some sudden
heartache the unkind words called up. Very low, and
sweet, and earnest was her reply:</p>

<p>“What do we do with our beggings? Oh, that is a
hard question to ask of one whose way of life leads ever
among the poor, the sorrowing, the unfortunate, the most
wretched of mankind. Not on me is it wasted. I stand
here in my earthly all. What do we do with it? Ah! some
day you may know.’</p>

<p>“She turned away and left him, sad of face, heavy of
heart, and her dark eyes misty with unshed tears.</p>

<p>“‘Stay!’</p>

<p>“The General’s request was like a command. He could
be stern; nay, almost rude, but he knew truth and worth
when he saw it, and could be just. The Sister paused on
the threshold, and for a minute nothing was heard but
the rapid scratching of the General’s pen.</p>

<p>“‘There, madam, is your order on the Commissary for
ice and beef at army terms, good for three months. I do
it for the sake of the Union Soldiers who are, or may be, in
your care. Don’t come bothering me again. Good-morning!’</p>

<p>“In less than three weeks from that day the slaughter
of the Red River campaign had been perfected, and there
neared the city of New Orleans a steamer flying the ominous
yellow flag, which even the rebel sharpshooters respected
and allowed to pass down the river unmolested. Another,
and still another, followed closely in her wake, and all
the decks were covered with the wounded and dying
whose bloody bandages and, in many instances, undressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
wounds gave woeful evidence of the lack of surgeons, as
well as the completeness of the rout. Among the desperately
wounded was General S. He was borne from the steamer
to the waiting ambulance, writhing in anguish from the
pain of his bleeding and shell-torn limb, and when they
asked him where he wished to be taken he feebly moaned:</p>

<p>“‘Anywhere, it matters not. Where I can die in
peace.’</p>

<p>“So they took him to the Hotel Dieu, a noble and
beautiful institution, in charge of the Sisters of Charity.
The limb was amputated and then he was nursed for weeks
through the agony of the surgical operation, the fever, the
wild delirium; and for many weary days no one could tell
whether life or death would be the victor. But who was
the quiet, faithful nurse, ever at his bedside, ever ministering
to his wants, ever watchful of his smallest needs? Why
only ‘one of the Sisters.’</p>

<p>“At last life triumphed, reason returned, and with it
much of the old, abrupt manner. The General awoke to
consciousness to see a face not altogether unknown bending
over him, and to feel a pair of small, deft hands skillfully
arranging a bandage, wet in ice-cold water, around his
throbbing temples, where the mad pain and aching had
for so long a time held sway. He was better now, though
still very weak; but his mind was clear, and he could think
calmly and connectedly of all that had taken place since
the fatal battle&mdash;a battle which had so nearly cost him his
life and left him at best but a maimed and mutilated remnant
of his former self.</p>

<p>“Yet he was thankful it was no worse&mdash;that he had
not been killed outright. In like degree he was grateful
to those who nursed him so tenderly and tirelessly, especially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
the gray-robed woman, who had become almost angelic
in his eyes; and it was like him to express his gratitude
in his own peculiar way, without preface or circumlocution.
Looking intently at the Sister, as if to get her
features well fixed in his memory, he said:</p>

<p>“‘Did you get the ice and beef?’</p>

<p>“The Sister started. The question was so direct and
unexpected. Surely her patient must be getting&mdash;really
himself!</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ she replied simply, but with a kind glance of
the soft, sad eyes, that spoke eloquently her thanks.</p>

<p>“‘And your name is &mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘Sister Francis.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, then, Sister Francis, I am glad you got the
things&mdash;glad I gave you the order. I think I know now
what you do with your beggings. I comprehend something
of your work, your charity, your religion, and I hope to be
the better for the knowledge. I owe you a debt I can
never repay, but you will endeavor to believe that I am
deeply grateful for all your great goodness and ceaseless
care.’</p>

<p>“‘Nay; you owe me nothing; but to Him, whose
cross I bear and in whose Divine footsteps I try to
follow, you owe a debt of gratitude unbounded. To His infinite
mercy I commend you. It matters not for the body;
it is that divine mystery, the soul, I would save. My work
here is done. I leave you to the care of others. Adieu.’</p>

<p>“The door softly opened and closed, and he saw Sister
Francis no more.</p>

<p>“Two months afterward she received a letter sent to
the care of the Mother Superior, inclosing a check for a
thousand dollars. At the same time the General took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
occasion to remark that he wished he were able to make
it twice the amount, since he knew by experience ‘What
they did with their beggings.’”</p>

<p>With this portion of the book is concluded the record
of the labors of the Catholic Sisterhoods in the war. The
appendix which follows contains a number of interesting
facts which it was deemed advisable to separate from
the text proper. Most of them have reference, either directly
or indirectly, to the patience, courage and loyalty
of the Sisters. Those that have not are sufficiently allied
to the subject matter to justify their insertion
in a volume of this character. Before the book
went to press the writer went over this additional
matter with a view to omitting some portions
that did not appear directly related to the main volume.
But it was difficult to make a choice. No two persons could
agree upon the part to be retained and the portion to be
omitted. So all of the matter has remained as it was originally
conceived and arranged.</p>

<p>No one can read the story of the labors of the heroic
women in the war without a thrill of reverence and admiration
for these devoted nurses. They constitute “a
grand army of the Republic” before which the boys in Blue
and the boys in Gray, and their descendants after them,
can bow the head in respectful salutation. They “enlisted
in the war” from motives of the highest patriotism&mdash;love
of humanity and love of God. They had no purpose
to accomplish, no axes to grind, no reward to receive, no
pay to earn! They did not forsake their peaceful convent
homes, share the privations and the rough fare of the soldiers,
to gratify any worldly ambition. All that they did
was from a pure and elevated sense of duty. The high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
motives that inspired them in volunteering their services
at the crisis in this nation’s history has also prevented
them from recording or publishing the amount and character
of these services. Their light has literally been hid
beneath a bushel. This feeble effort to do justice to their
labors and their memory has been undertaken, not because
they would have it done, but because duty, justice
and patriotism alike demanded that it should be done. If
the perusal of these pages furnishes the reader one-tenth
of the pleasure involved in their making, the writer will
be well repaid for his labor.</p>

HONORED BY THE QUEEN.</h3>

<p>The Queen of England only a few months ago showed
her appreciation of the work of the Sisters in time of war
by bestowing the Royal Red Cross upon the venerable
Mother Aloysius Doyle, of the Convent of Mercy, Gort,
Ireland. The following correspondence deserves to be preserved:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
Pall Mall, London, S. W.,<br />
February 15, 1897.<br />
</p>

<p>Madam:&mdash;The Queen having been pleased to bestow
upon you the decoration of the Royal Red Cross, I have
to inform you that in the case of such honors as this it is
the custom of Her Majesty to personally bestow the decoration
upon the recipient when such a course is convenient
to all concerned, and I have, therefore, to request that
you will be so good as to inform me whether it would be
convenient to you to attend at Windsor some time within
the next few weeks. Should any circumstances prevent
your receiving the Royal Red Cross from the hands of
Her Majesty it could be transmitted by post to your present
address. I am, madam, your obedient servant,</p>

<p>Sir:&mdash;I received your letter of the 15th, intimating to
me that Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen is pleased
to bestow on me the Order of the Royal Cross in recognition
of the services of my Sisters in religion and my own
in caring for the wounded soldiers at the Crimea during
the war. My words cannot express my gratitude for the
great honor which Her Majesty is pleased to confer on
me. The favor is, if possible, enhanced by the permission
to receive this public mark of favor at Her Majesty’s
own hands. The weight of seventy-six years and the infirmities
of age will, I trust, dispense me from the journey
to the palace. I will, therefore, with sentiments of deepest
gratitude ask to be permitted to receive this mark of my
Sovereign’s favor in the less public and formal manner
you have kindly indicated. I am, sir, faithfully yours in
Jesus Christ,</p>

VETERANS OF THE CRIMEAN WAR.</h3>

<p>In August, 1897, at the close of the ceremonies incident
to the celebration of her Diamond Jubilee, the Queen
of Great Britain conferred the decoration of the Royal
Red Cross upon Army Nursing Sisters Mary Helen Ellis,
Mary Stanilaus Jones, Mary Anastasia Kelly and Mary de
Chantal Huddon, in recognition of their services in tending
the sick and wounded at the seat of war during the
Crimean campaign of 1854-56. Their services were very
much appreciated by Miss Nightingale, who, indeed, has
ever since shown her interest in them in many ways.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

<p>The three Sisters first mentioned, together with another
who has died since, were on their return from the East,
asked to undertake the nursing at a hospital, just then being
established in Great Ormond street, for incurable and
dying female patients, and to this hospital they have been
attached to the present time.</p>

POOR SISTER ST. CLAIRE.</h3>

<p>Professor Edward Roth, the well-known Philadelphia
educator, is authority for this episode of the Franco-German
war. He quotes General Ambert, who fought as a
private in the war, as follows:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; one of them I shall never forget. Poor Sister
St. Claire! I see her this moment, her big black veil
trimmed with blue, as she makes her way through the
blood-smeared straw of our crowded barn. The roaring of
the cannon was awful, but she did not seem to mind it;
she did not seem to mind even the terrible fire that was
now raging through the last houses of the village, the
flames near enough to cast an unearthly glimmer on the
suffering faces of the wounded men. But, oh! how her
sharp ear caught the slightest complaint! How she flew
towards the faintest whisper!</p>

<p>“Everywhere at once&mdash;with each one of us at the same
time! What iron strength God must have put into that
little body! Your eye had hardly caught glimpse of it
when you felt already at your lips the cool refreshing drink
that you had not the courage to ask for. You had hardly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
opened your dimmed eyes, heavy with pain and fever,
when you were aware of a face bending over you, keen, indeed,
and bright, though slightly poxmarked; but so resolute,
calm, smiling and kindly that you instantly forgot your
sufferings, forgot the Prussians with their bombs bursting
around you, forgot even the conflagration that was drawing
nearer and nearer and threatened soon to swallow up
the barn in which our ambulances had taken shelter.
Good Sister St. Claire, you are now with your God, the
voluntary victim of your heart and your faith, but I have
often wished since that you were once more among us,
listening to the thanks and prayers of such of us as are
still alive and never to forget you. But you did not hear
even the tenth part of the blessings of those that died
with your name on their lips as they sank to their eternal
sleep tranquilly, resignedly, hopefully, thanks to your
holy ministrations!</p>

<p>“It was the evening of August 16, 1870, the day of our
bloodiest battle&mdash;Gravelotte. For hours and hours the
wounded had been carried persistently and in great numbers
to the rear. In a large barn near Rezonville those of
us had been laid whose intense sufferings would not permit
them to be removed further. Thrown hurriedly down
wherever room could be found, the first arms you saw extending
towards you, were those of that little dark-faced
woman, her lips smiling, but her eyes glistening with tears.
A few yards only from the field of battle, from the very
thick of the fight; a few yards only from the muddy, blood-slipping
ground where you had just sunk, fully expecting
to be soon trampled to death like so many others, what
heavenly comfort it was to meet such burning charity!
How it at once relieved your physical sufferings, soothed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
off your mortification and drove away your deadening
despair!</p>

<p>“Poor Sister St. Claire! All that evening and all that
long night to get water for the fifty agonized voices calling
for it every moment you had to cross a yard hissing with
bullets, but every five minutes out you went with your two
buckets and back you soon came as serene and undisturbed
as if God Himself had made you invulnerable.
And so the long night wore away.</p>

<p>“But next morning our army, after a fifteen hours’
valiant struggle and after resting all night on the battlefield,
had to fall back towards Metz, and the barn had to
be immediately vacated. There was no time for using the
regular ambulances, for the Prussians, though they could
not take any of our positions the previous evening, being
heavily reinforced were now steadily advancing. The
wounded, picked up hastily and carried out without ceremony,
were piled on trucks, tumbrils and every available
vehicle.</p>

<p>“Oh, the cries! the pains! the sufferings! Still, dear
Sister St. Claire, though for forty-eight hours you hadn’t
had a second for your own rest, you contrived to pass continually
from one end of that wretched column to the
other, with a little water for this one, a good word for that,
a smile or friendly nod for a third, your little arms lifting
out of danger a head that leaned over too far, or shifting
into a more comfortable position the poor fellow whose
leg had been cut off during the night and who would
probably be dead in an hour or two. Then you found a
seat for yourself on the last wagon.</p>

<p>“Alas! you were not there half an hour when the bullet
struck you&mdash;struck you as you were striving to keep a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
poor, wounded, helpless man from rolling out. A squadron
of Uhlans suddenly cut us off from the army and made us
all prisoners.</p>

<p>“Poor Sister! It was by the hands of our enemies that
the grave was dug where you are now lying in the midst
of those on whom you expended the treasures of your
saintly soul. Of us that survive you there is probably not
one in a thousand that will ever know the name of that
little Sister of the Trinity&mdash;in religion Sister St. Claire&mdash;that
bright vision of charity flashing continually before us
during the long ride of agony in the barn near Rezonville.</p>

<p>“Your holy limbs are now resting in an unknown corner
of Lorraine&mdash;no longer your dear France&mdash;but your
blessed memory will live forever in the grateful hearts of
those you have died for!”</p>

LORD NAPIER’S TESTIMONY.</h3>

<p>Lord Napier, who held a diplomatic position under
Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, in Constantinople, during the
Crimean War, gives the following testimony to the worth
of the Sisters of Mercy:</p>

<p>“During the distress of the Crimean war the Ambassador
called me in one morning and said: ‘Go down to
the port; you will find a ship there loaded with Jewish exiles,
Russian subjects from the Crimea. It is your duty to
disembark them. The Turks will give you a house in
which they may be placed. I turn them over entirely to
you.’ I went down to the shore and received about 200
persons, the most miserable objects that could be witnessed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
most of them old men, women and children, sunk
in the lowest depths of indigence and despair. I placed
them in the cold, ruinous lodging allocated to them by
the Ottoman authorities. I went back to the Ambassador
and said: ‘Your Excellency, those people are cold and
I have no fuel or blankets; they are hungry, and I have
no food; they are very dirty, and I have no soap; their
hair is in an undesirable condition and I have no combs.
What am I to do with these people?’ ‘Do?’ said the Ambassador;
‘get a couple of Sisters of Mercy; they will put
all to rights in a moment.’ I went, saw the Mother Superior
and explained the case. I asked for two Sisters.
They were at once sent. They were ladies of refinement
and intellect. I was a stranger and a Protestant, and I invoked
their assistance for the benefit of Jews. Yet these
two women made up their bundles and followed me
through the rain without a look, a whisper or a sign of hesitation.
From that moment my fugitives were saved. No
one saw the labors of those Sisters for months but myself,
and they never endeavored to make a single convert.”</p>

<p>In his speeches in after times Lord Napier repeatedly
referred to the singular zeal and devotedness constantly
shown by the Sisters to the sick of every denomination. On
one occasion, in Edinburgh, he remarked that the Sisters
faithfully kept their promise not to interfere with the religion
of non-Catholics, but, continued his Lordship, “they
made at least one convert; they converted me, if not to believe
in the Catholic faith, at least to believe in the Sisters
of Mercy.”</p>

<p>The few months spent at Balaklava by the devoted
Sisters witnessed a repetition of the deeds of heroism
which had achieved such happy results at Scutari and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
Koulali. The cholera and a malignant type of fever had
broken out in those days in the camp. By night as well as
by day the Sisters were called to help the patients, yet
their strength seemed never to fail in their work of charity.
Besides the soldiers, there were sick civilians, Maltese,
Germans, Greeks, Italians, Americans and even negroes,
and to all they endeavored to give some attention.</p>

<p>The medical orders reveal the constant nature of the
nursing required at their hands. At one time the doctor
“requests that a Sister would sit up with his Dutch patient
in No. 9 ward to-night.” Again, “Sisters to sit up with the
Maltese and the Arab.” “Kind attendance on Jones every
night would be necessary until a notification to the contrary
be given.” “Keep the stump moist; a little champagne
and water to be given during the night.” “Elliot is
to be watched all night; powder every half hour; wine in
small dose if necessary.” The very confidence placed by
the physicians in their careful treatment added to their
toil. As the deputy purveyor-in-chief reported to the Government
in December, 1855: “The medical officer can
safely consign his most critical case to their hands; stimulants
or opiates ordered every five minutes will be faithfully
administered, though the five minutes’ labor were repeated
uninterruptedly for a week.”</p>

<p>The heroism of the nuns, however, was now well
known in camp, and never did workers find more sympathetic
subordinates than the Sisters had in their orderlies.
The fact that they would never lodge complaints or have
the orderlies punished only made the men more zealous in
their service. One of the Sisters found it necessary to correct
her orderly. “Perhaps, James,” she said, “you do not
wish me to speak to you a little severely.” He at once interrupted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
her: “Troth, Sister, I glory in your speaking to
me. Sure, the day I came to Balaklava I cried with joy
when I saw your face.” One who had taken a glass too
much was so mortified at being seen by the Rev. Mother&mdash;whom
the soldiers call their commander-in-chief&mdash;that he
sobbed like a child. Another in the same predicament hid
himself that he might not be seen by the Sister. He had
never hidden from the enemy; a medal with three clasps
bore eloquent testimony to his bravery. “I don’t like to
say anything harsh,” said the Sister. “Speak, ma’am,” interrupted
the delinquent; “the words out of your blessed
mouth are like jewels falling over me.”</p>

<p>One of the Sisters writes: “We have not a cross here
with anyone. The medical officers all work beautifully
with us. They quite rely on our obedience. Sir John Hall,
the head medical officer of the army, is quite loud in his
promise of the nuns. The hospital and its hunts are scattered
over a hill. The respect of all for the Sisters is daily increasing.
Don’t be shocked to hear that I am so accustomed
to the soldiers now and so sure of their respect and
affection that I don’t mind them more than the school children.”
The soldiers in the camp envied the good fortune
of stratagem to have a few words with the nuns. “Please,
sir,” they would say to the chaplain, “do send a couple of
us on an errand to the hospital to get a sight of the nuns.”</p>

<p>As the time for the nuns’ departure approached the
cordial manifestations of respect and kindly feeling were
only the more multiplied. “The grateful affection of the
soldiers (a Sister writes) is most touching, often ludicrous.
They swarm around us like flocks of chickens. A black-veiled
nun, in the midst of red coats all eyes and ears for
whatever she says to them, is an ordinary sight at Balaklava.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
Our doors were besieged by them to get some little
keepsake; a book in which we write ‘Given by a Sister of
Mercy’ is so valuable an article that a Protestant declared
he would rather have such a gift than the Victoria Cross
or Crimean medal.”</p>

<p>The Sunday after the nuns’ departure the men who
went to the chapel sobbed and cried as though their
hearts would break. When the priest turned to speak to
them and asked their prayers for the safe passage of the
nuns they could not control their emotion. “I was obliged
to cut short my discourse,” wrote the chaplain, “else I
should have cried and sobbed with my poor men.” This
sympathy was shown by Protestants and Catholics alike,
and from the commander-in-chief to the private soldier,
from the first medical officers to the simple presser in the
surgery, all was a chorus in praise of the “untiring, judicious
and gentle nursing of the Sisters of Mercy.”</p>

<p>Two Sisters of Mercy were summoned to their crowns
from the hospitals of the East. One was English, a lay
Sister from the convent at Liverpool. She fell a victim to
the cholera which raged at Balaklava. The other was a
choir Sister from Ireland, Sister M. Elizabeth Butler. Already
rumors of peace had brought joy to the camp, when
toward the close of February 7, 1855, she caught typhus
attending the sick and in a few days joyfully bade farewell
to the world. One of the surviving Sisters describes her
funeral. The Eighty-ninth Regiment obtained the honor
and privilege of bearing the coffin to the grave. One officer
earnestly desired to be among the chosen, but thought he
was not worthy, as he had not been at Holy Communion on
that morning. The whole medical staff attended. The
Sisters of Charity at the Sardinian camp sent five of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
number to express sympathy and condolence. Eight chaplains
attended to perform the last rites for the heroine of
charity.</p>

<p>The place of interment was beside the departed lay
Sister, on a rocky hill rising over the waters of the Black
Sea. The funeral was a most impressive sight. The soldiers
in double file, the multitudes of various nations,
ranks and employments, the silence unbroken, save by the
voice of tears, the groups, still as statuary that crowded
the rocks above the grave, the moaning of the sullen
waves beneath, all combined in a weird pageant never to
be forgotten by the thousands that took part in it. The
graves of these cherished Sisters were tended with loving
attention. Marked by crosses and enclosed by a high iron
railing set in cut stone, they are still quite visible from the
Black Sea beneath. Many a pilgrim went thither to strew
the graves with flowers; and to the present day many a
vessel entering the Black Sea lowers its flag in memory of
those heroines, who in the true spirit of charity devoted
their lives to alleviate the suffering of their countrymen.</p>

VERY REV. JAMES FRANCIS BURLANDO, C. M.</h3>

<p>The Very Rev. James Francis Burlando, of the Congregation
of the Mission, who is mentioned several times
in the text of this volume, was born on May 6, 1814, in the
city of Genoa, Italy. Very early in life he became impressed
with the desire of adopting the priesthood as his
vocation, and on the 16th of February, 1837, his Archbishop,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
Cardinal Tadini, conferred on him the holy orders of
sub-deacon and deacon.</p>

<p>Soon after this he sailed for the United States and enlisted
for the American missions under Rev. John Odin, C.
M., late Archbishop of New Orleans, who at that time was
seeking recruits for the infant seminary at the Barrens,
Missouri. Before Father Burlando could come here he
was obliged to meet and overcome a very strong opposition
on the part of his good father, who, although a fervent
Christian, could not bear the idea of being separated from
his first-born son.</p>

<p>The very day that Father Burlando was to be admitted
to the novitiate he perceived his father at the Archepiscopal
Hall, waiting for an audience with Cardinal Tadini.
Guessing at once the motive of such an interview,
namely, that he might exercise his authority and command
the young deacon, in virtue of holy obedience, to
remain with his father and family, which would prevent
him from carrying out his holy desire, the young man
sought to baffle the intention of his father by seeing the
Archbishop first and securing his permission and blessing.</p>

<p>Accordingly he had recourse to the following stratagem:
He borrowed from his friends the various articles
of a clerical suit; from one a hat, from another a cassock
differing from his own, from a third a cloak, and, to render
the disguise more complete, he put on a pair of spectacles
and wig. Thus equipped, he entered the house of the
Cardinal, had a conversation with him, in which he received
his approbation and blessing, and passed out again
without being recognized by his father, who he left standing
at the door watching closely every young seminarian
who entered. Fearing he might be discovered, the young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
man quickened his pace, and repaired immediately to the
venerable R. Bartholomew Gazzano, then Superior of the
Lazarists, who received him.</p>

<p>In the following June he left Genoa and repaired to
Turin, where he was ordained priest on the 9th of July by
the Most Rev. Aloysius Fransoni, Archbishop of that See.
To mitigate in some measure the pain which his good father
experienced on account of this separation, Father Burlando
wrote him a pressing invitation to honor and gratify
him by being present at his first Mass, on the 10th of July.
Touched by his son’s filial respect and affection, he at last
relented and assisted with tearful devotion at the impressive
ceremony.</p>

<p>A few weeks after Father Burlando went to the
Mother House, in Paris, whence he set out for New Orleans.
Having landed safely on the American shore, he
proceeded by steamboat to Missouri, and reached the Seminary
of the Barrens towards the close of the same year.
He filled many positions of trust and honor. The last and
most important field of his apostolic labors was the Community
of the Daughters of Charity, at the Central House
of St. Joseph’s, near Emmittsburg, Md., whither he repaired
in the spring of 1853, and where he remained for
the space of twenty-three years.</p>

<p>“During all that time,” says Father Gandolfo, his assistant,
“I had more occasion than anyone else of observing
his noble qualities of mind and heart. As a Superior
he was always kind, discreet, obliging, generous, amiable
and edifying in all that regarded the observance even of
the least rule, beginning from rising at 4 o’clock in the
morning at the first sound of the Benedicamus Domino.
He was exceedingly charitable and ever ready to assist me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
at the first request in the performance of my duties, and
this notwithstanding his frequent attacks of neuralgia
and weakness of the digestive organs. I never saw him
misspend a minute of his time. If he was not occupied in
answering his numerous correspondents he was drawing
plans of hospitals and other buildings, or attending to
similar important affairs of the Community. He never retired
to rest without having first read the many letters he
daily received from every quarter of the United States. Although
he frequently retired very late and slept but a few
hours during the night, he was always ready for the hard
labor of the next day.”</p>

<p>It was largely due to the wise administration of this
worthy director that the Community owed, and owes, its
singular prosperity and development. It suffices to state
that when he assumed the duties of his position there were
only three hundred members distributed among thirty-six
houses, and he lived to see the white Cornette on the brow
of one thousand and forty-five Daughters of St. Vincent,
having under their control ninety-seven establishments
for the service of the poor, affording relief for almost every
species of misfortune. Owing to his superior knowledge of
architecture, he not only planned but personally supervised
the erection of the greater number of these charitable
institutions.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to enumerate the long and
painful journeys he took, the multiplied dangers to which
he exposed himself, and the many privations he endured
for the particular welfare of the different establishments
of the Sisters. How many sleepless nights he passed during
our late civil war! There were Sisters in the North
and Sisters in the South, but, by his constant vigilance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
his consummate prudence, his repeated fatherly admonitions,
and especially by his continual and fervent prayers,
he had the consolation of seeing the entire Community
free from all reproach and danger.</p>

<p>He has left many valuable volumes which prove his
ability as a writer as well as a thinker. One of these is
the “Ceremonial,” which was entrusted to him by the Most
Rev. Archbishop Kenrick, approved by the Provincial
Council, and which is now largely used throughout the
United States. In this valuable work all the details relative
to the Mass and offices of the Church, the sacred vessels
and other articles used are minutely described, so that
solemnity, beauty and becoming uniformity may be maintained.
He also compiled the life of Father De Andreis,
the pioneer of the Lazerists in this country. To him we
are also indebted for the publication of the beautiful life
of “Sister Eugenie, Daughter of Charity.”</p>

<p>A person remarked that he must be well and extensively
known throughout the United States, as he was always
traveling and had to register his name in the hotels.
“Oh, no,” he replied, “I give my name in as many different
languages as I can. In this way I pass unnoticed, and get
a little recreation at the expense of the poor recorder, who
is often at a loss to spell the foreign name. He looks bewildered,
repeats it several times, and casts an inquiring
glance at me; meantime I pretend stupidity and leave him
write whatever he likes. Then, you see, Francis Burlando
is not known.”</p>

<p>This devoted priest breathed his last on Sunday, February
16, 1873, at the close of a day well spent in the exercise
of his sacred functions. The funeral service took
place in the Central House of the Sisters of Charity, St.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
Joseph’s, Emmittsburg, February 19, and the remains were
interred in the little cemetery of the Sisters of Charity, besides
the mortuary chapel, wherein repose the venerated
remains of Saintly Mother Seton, foundress of the Sisters
of Charity in the United States.</p>

MOTHER SETON.</h3>

<p>Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton, the founder and first
Superior of the Sisters of Charity in the United States,
was one of the most remarkable women in the history of
the Catholic Church in America. She was reared in the
doctrines of the Protestant Episcopal Church and did not
embrace the Catholic faith until after the death of her
husband.</p>

<p>This distinguished woman, who was born in the city
of New York on the 28th of August, 1774, was a younger
daughter of Dr. Richard Bayley, an eminent physician of
the metropolis. Her mother died when she was but three
years of age, but her father watched over her with all the
loving care of a good parent. As Miss Bayley advanced in
years, nature and education combined in developing those
admirable traits of character that were to make her so
lovable and merciful in later life. All of her friends and
relatives were members of the Protestant Episcopal
Church, but the physician’s daughter was more fervent in
her religious duties than any of those with whom she was
associated. From her earliest years she wore a small crucifix
on her person, and was frequently heard to express
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
regret and astonishment that the custom was not more
general among the members of her church.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty Miss Bayley was married to
William Seton, a prosperous and most estimable merchant,
of New York city. It was a happy marriage, and husband
and wife lived in mutual love and esteem. In 1800
Mr. Seton became embarrassed through a reaction in business,
caused mainly by the consequences of the Revolutionary
war. In this crisis Mrs. Seton was a help-mate in
every sense of the word. She not only cheered her husband
by her encouraging counsel, but rendered him practical
aid in arranging his business affairs.</p>

<p>In the course of her married life Mrs. Seton became
the mother of five children, Anna Maria, William, Richard,
Catherine Josephine and Rebecca. She was a model
mother, restraining, guiding and educating her offspring
with a mingling of tact, tenderness and edifying example.
She did not confine her goodness to her children, but was
ever ready to assist the poor and suffering. One of her
biographers says she was so zealous in this respect “that
she and a relative who accompanied her were commonly
called Protestant Sisters of Charity.”</p>

<p>The death of Mrs. Seton’s father in 1801 was a source
of great sorrow to this devoted woman. Years had only
served to cement the affectionate relations between father
and daughter. During the last three or four years of his
life Dr. Bayley was Health Officer at the Port of New
York. He was naturally of a philanthropic disposition,
and his official duties called him to a field that presented
an unbounded field for Christian charity. It was while in
the discharge of his duty among the immigrants that Dr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
Bayley contracted the illness which carried him to his
grave within a week’s time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seton had scarcely recovered from the shock of
her father’s death when her husband’s health, which had
never been robust, began to decline rapidly. A sea voyage
and a sojourn in Italy were recommended. Mrs. Seton
could not permit her husband to travel alone in his weak
and exhausted state, and she accompanied him, along with
her oldest child, a girl of eight. The other children were
committed to the care of relatives in New York city. The
child caught the whooping cough on the way over, and
the anxious mother was constantly occupied in nursing the
husband and daughter. Before landing the unfortunate
trio were detained for many days at the lazaretto station in
the harbor of Leghorn. After they landed the good wife
was untiring in her attentions to her husband, but, in spite
of her love and solicitude, he died on the 27th of December
“among strangers and in a foreign land.”</p>

<p>On the following 8th of April, with her tears still
fresh upon the grave of her devoted husband, Mrs. Seton
sailed for home. Prior to this voyage and during the fifty-six
days that it occupied, Mrs. Seton began to take a deep
interest in the doctrines and practices of the Catholic
Church. She eagerly devoured all of the literature upon
the subject that opportunity offered, and also learned
much by frequent conversations with friends. Deep meditation
finally strengthened her in the desire to become a
Catholic. Her only fear was that a change in her religious
faith might bring about a coldness and a severance of the
friendship that existed between herself and her friends
and relatives&mdash;particularly her pastor&mdash;Rev. J. H. Hobart,
a man of singular talent and goodness, who afterwards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
became the Protestant Episcopal Bishop of New
York.</p>

<p>Writing of the possibility of such an estrangement in
her diary at this time, Mrs. Seton says with evident feeling:
“If your dear friendship and esteem must be the
price of my fidelity to what I believe to be the truth, I cannot
doubt the mercy of God, who, by depriving me of one of
my remaining dearest ties on earth, will certainly draw
me nearer to Him.” She was not mistaken. When she returned
home the coldness of many of her Protestant
friends was a great trial to her warm and still bleeding
heart. The storm of opposition added to her grief.</p>

<p>The fact that Mrs. Seton was in doubt upon the question
of religion made her a subject of attack for the friends
of all denominations. Writing of this, she says: “I had
a most affectionate note from Mr. Hobart to-day, asking
me how I could ever think of leaving the Church in which
I was baptized. But, though whatever he says has the
weight of my partiality for him, as well as the respect it
seems to me I could scarcely have for anyone else, yet that
question made me smile; for it is like saying that wherever
a child is born and wherever its parents place it, there it
will find the truth; and he does not hear the droll invitations
made me every day since I am in my little new home
and old friends come to see me.</p>

<p>“It has already happened that one of the most excellent
women I ever knew, who is of the Church of Scotland,
finding me unsettled about the great object of a true faith,
said to me: ‘Oh, do, dear soul, come and hear our J. Mason
and I am sure you will join us.’</p>

<p>“A little after came one whom I loved, for the purest
and most innocent of manners, of the Society of Quakers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
(to which I have always been attached), she coaxed me,
too, with artless persuasion: ‘Betsey, I tell thee, thee had
better come with us.’ And my faithful old friend of the
Anabaptist meeting, Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash;, says, with tears in her
eyes: ‘Oh! could you be regenerated; could you know our
experiences and enjoy with us our heavenly banquet.’
And my good old Mary, the Methodist, groans and contemplates,
as she calls it, over my soul, so misled because
I have got no convictions. But, oh, my Father and My
God! all that will not do for me. Your word is truth, and
without contradiction, whatever it is. One faith, one hope,
one baptism, I look for, whatever it is, and I often think my
sins, my miseries, hide the light. Yet I will cling and hold
to my God to the last gasp, begging for that light, and
never change until I find it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Seton’s doubts were finally set at rest, and on
Ash Wednesday, 1805, she was received into Catholicism
in old St. Peter’s Church, New York city. The embarrassed
state of her husband’s finances at the time of his death
had involved her, and she opened a boarding house for some
of the boys who attended a neighboring school. Some
months later Miss Cecilia Seton, the youngest sister-in-law
of Mrs. Seton, followed her into the Catholic Church. The
one thought of Mrs. Seton was now to devote her life to
the poor and to the Church. The opportunity came sooner
than she anticipated. The co-operation of the Church authorities,
and financial resources being forthcoming, a little
Community was formed in St. Joseph’s Valley, Emmittsburg.
Vows were taken in accordance with the
rules of the institute of the Sisters of Charity,
of France, and in a few months ten
Sisters were employed with the instruction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
youth and the care of the sick. They were poor but happy.
The first Christmas day, for instance, “they rejoiced to
have some smoked herring for dinner.” Rigid regulations
were adopted for the government of the new order, and its
growth was remarkable. Mother Seton had the satisfaction
of receiving her eldest daughter into the Sisterhood.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seton’s youngest daughter lived into the nineties
and died recently in the Mercy Convent, New York, where
she had lived as a Sister of Mercy for over forty years.
The sons of Mrs. Seton were prosperously launched in
business enterprises.</p>

<p>Mother Seton died on the 4th of January, 1821, in
the forty-seventh year of her age. Her bedside was surrounded
by the dark-robed Sisters of Charity and her only
surviving daughter, Josephine. Her end was happy and
tranquil. Her career was one of great piety and usefulness.
She has gone but her memory will live forever
through the perpetration of the great order that she planted
in the United States, and which has already grown to
proportions far beyond the most sanguine expectation of
its tender and affectionate founder.</p>

“THE SISTER OF CHARITY.”</h3>

<p>This beautiful poem, descriptive of a Sister of Charity,
written by Gerald Griffin, has taken its place among those
precious bits of literature that never die. The author was
born in Limerick, Ireland, in 1803, and began his literary
career as a reporter for a London daily. He wrote many
novels, a tragedy and various poems. He died in Cork, in
1840.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

<p>A correspondent whose opinion is valued very highly
writes to remind the author of the “Angels of the Battlefield”
that a society of Sisters of Charity was first established
in Dublin by Mary Mother Aikenhead early in this
century. It was these ladies, particularly a sister and a
cousin of the poet who joined Mother Aikenhead, that inspired
Gerald Griffin’s beautiful lines. The Irish Sisters
of Charity make perpetual vows, wear veils and dress somewhat
similar to the Sisters of Mercy. They are not connected
with any other congregation. The “Sister of Charity”
is as follows:</p>

SISTERS OF CHARITY.</h3>

<p>(In Mr. Southey’s “Sir Thomas More” the following
account of the Beguines of Belgium and the Sisters of
Charity of France is reprinted from the London Medical
Gazette, Vol. I.)</p>

<p>A few summers ago I passed through Flanders on my
way to Germany, and at the hospital at Bruges saw some
of the Beguines, and heard the physician, with whom I was
intimate, speak in strong terms of their services. He
said: “There are no such nurses.” I saw them in the
wards attending on the sick, and in the chapel of the hospital
on their knees washing the floor. They were obviously
a superior class of women, and the contrast was
striking between these menial offices and the respectability
of their dress and appearance; but the Beguinage of
Ghent is one of their principal establishments, and, spending
a Sunday there, I went in the evening to vespers. It
was twilight when I entered the chapel. It was dimly
lighted by two or three tall tapers before the altar and a
few candles at the remotest end of the building, in the orchestra,
but the body of the chapel was in deep gloom,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
filled from end to end with several hundreds of these nuns
seated in rows, in their dark dresses and white cowls, silent
and motionless, excepting now and then one of them
started up, and, stretching out her arms in the attitude of
the crucifixion, stood in that posture many minutes, then
sank and disappeared among the crowd. The gloom of the
chapel, the long line of these unearthly-looking figures,
like so many corpses propped up in their grave clothes&mdash;the
dead silence of the building, once only interrupted by a
few voices in the distant orchestra chanting vespers, was
one of the most striking sights I ever beheld. To some
readers, the occasional attitude of the nuns may seem an
absurd expression of fanaticism, but they are anything but
fanatics. Whoever is accustomed to the manners of Continental
nations knows that they employ a grimace in
everything. I much doubt whether, apart from the internal
emotion of piety, the external expression of it is graceful
in anyone, save only a little child in his night-shirt, on
his knees, saying his evening prayer.</p>

<p>The Beguinage, or residence of the Beguines at Ghent,
is a little town of itself, adjoining the city, and inclosed
from it. The transition from the crowded streets of Ghent
to the silence and solitude of the Beguinage is very striking.
The houses in which the Beguines reside are contiguous,
each having its small garden, and on the door the
name, not of the resident, but of the protecting saint of
the house; these houses are ranged into streets. There is
also the large church, which we visited, and a burial ground,
in which there are no monuments. There are upwards of
six hundred of these nuns in the Beguinage of Ghent, and
about six thousand in Brabant and Flanders. They receive
sick persons into the Beguinage, and not only nurse,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
but support them, until they are recovered; they also go
out to nurse the sick. They are bound by no vow excepting
to be chaste and obedient while they remain in the order;
they have the power of quitting it and returning again
into the world whenever they please, but this, it is said,
they seldom or never do. They are most of them women,
unmarried, or widows past the middle of life. In 1244 a
synod at Fritzlau decided that no Beguine should be
younger than 40 years of age. They generally dine together
in the refectory; their apartments are barely yet comfortably
furnished, and, like all the habitations of Flanders,
remarkably clean. About their origin and name little is
known by the Beguines themselves, or is to be found in
books. For the following particulars I am chiefly indebted
to the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire des Ordres Monastiques</span>” (tome viii):</p>

<p>Some attributed both their origin and name to St.
Begghe, who lived in the seventh century; others to Lambert
le Begue, who lived about the end of the twelfth century.
This latter saint is said to have founded two Communities
of them at Liege, one for women, in 1173, the
other for men, in 1177. After his death they multiplied
fast, and were introduced by St. Louis into Paris and other
French cities. The plan flourished in France, and was
adopted under other forms and names. In 1443 Nicholas
Rollin, Chancellor to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy,
founded a hospital at Beaune and brought six Beguines
from Malines to attend upon it, and the hospital became so
famed for the care of its patients that the opulent people
of the neighborhood, when sick, were often removed to
it, preferring its attendance to what they received at
home. In one part of the hospital there was a large square
court, bordered with galleries leading to apartments suitable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
to such patients; when they quitted the hospital the
donations which they left were added to its funds.</p>

<p>The Soeurs de la Charite, of France, are another order
of religious nurses, but different from the Beguines in being
bound by monastic vows. They originated in a charity
sermon, perhaps the most useful and extensive in its influence
that ever was preached. Vincent de Paul, a celebrated
missionary, preaching at Chatillon, in 1617, recommended
a poor sick family of the neighborhood to the care of his
congregation. At the conclusion of the sermon a number
of persons visited the sick family with bread, wine, meat
and other comforts. This led to the formation of a committee
of charitable women, under the direction of Vincent
de Paul, who went about relieving the sick poor of the
neighborhood, and met every month to give an account of
their proceedings to their superior. Such was the origin
of the celebrated order of the Soeurs de la Charite.
Wherever this missionary went he attempted to form similar
establishments. From the country they spread to cities,
and first to Paris, where, in 1629, they were established
in the parish of St. Savious.</p>

<p>And in 1625 a female devotee, named Le Gras, joined
the order of the Soeurs de la Charite. She was married
young to M. Le Gras, one of whose family had founded a
hospital at Puy, but, becoming a widow in 1625, in the
thirty-fourth year of her age, she made a vow of celibacy,
and dedicated the rest of her life to the service of the poor.
In her Vincent de Paul found a great accession. Under his
direction she took many journeys, visiting and inspecting
the establishments which he had founded. She was commonly
accompanied by a few pious ladies. Many women
of quality enrolled themselves in the order, but the superiors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
*were assisted by inferior servants. The Hotel Dieu
was the first hospital in Paris where they exercised their
vocation. This they visited every day, supplying the patients
with comforts above what the hospital afforded, and
administering, besides, religious consolation. By degrees
they spread into all the provinces of France, and at length
the Queen of Poland requested Mademoiselle Le Gras, for
though a widow that was her title, to send her a supply of
Soeurs de la Charite, who were thus established in Varsovia,
in 1652. At length, after a long life spent in the
service of charity and religion, Mademoiselle Le Gras died
on the 15th of March, 1660, nearly seventy years of age,
and for a day and a half her body lay exposed to the gaze
of the pious.</p>

<p>A country clergyman, who spent several years in various
parts of France, gives an account of the present state
of the order, which, together with what I have gathered
from other sources, is in substance as follows: It consists
of women of all ranks, many of them of the higher orders.
After a year’s novitiate in the convent, they take a vow
which binds them to the order for the rest of their lives.
They have two objects, to attend the sick and to educate
the poor; they are spread all over France, are the superior
nurses at the hospitals, and are to be found in every town,
and often even in villages. Go into the Paris hospitals at
almost any hour of the day, and you will see one of these
respectable-looking women, in her black gown and white
hood, passing slowly from bed to bed, and stopping to inquire
of some poor wretch what little comfort he is fancying
will alleviate his sufferings. If a parochial cure
wants assistance in the care of his flock he applies to the
Order of Les Soeurs de la Charite. Two of them (for they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
generally go in couples), set out on their charitable mission;
wherever they travel their dress protects
them. “Even more enlightened persons
than the common peasantry hail it as a
happy omen when on a journey with a Soeur de la Charite
happens to travel with them, and even instances are recorded
in which their presence has saved travelers from
the attacks of robbers.” During the Revolution they were
rarely molested. They were the only religious order permitted
openly to wear their dress and pursue their vocation.
Government gives a hundred francs a year to each
Sister, besides her traveling expenses; and if the parish
where they go cannot maintain them, they are supported
out of the funds of the order. In old age they retire to
their convents and spend the rest of their lives in educating
the novitiates. Thus, like the vestal virgins of old,
the first part of their life is spent learning their duties,
the second in practicing them, and the last in teaching
them.</p>

CATHERINE ELIZABETH McAULEY.</h3>

<p>Miss Catherine Elizabeth McAuley, the foundress of
the Order of Sisters of Mercy, ranks high among the notable
women whose achievements have enriched the history
of the Catholic Church. The religious institution first
planted by her in the city of Dublin has spread to such an
extent that its branches now spread into at least every
quarter of the English-speaking globe. The communities
of the Sisters of Mercy in the United States have done excellent
work in many fields, but they particularly distinguished
themselves as nurses during the unhappy conflict
between the North and the South.</p>

<p>Miss McAuley was born September 29, 1787, at Stormanstown,
Dublin, Ireland. She was the daughter of
pious, well-known and respectable parents. Her father
was especially prominent by reason of his goodness to the
poor and the unfortunate. One of his regular practices
was to have all the poor of the vicinity come to his house
on Sundays and holidays for the purpose of instructing
them in their religion. Both father and mother died when
the subject of this sketch was very young.</p>

<p>Shortly after this unfortunate event Catherine was
adopted by Mr. and Mrs. William Callahan, who belonged
to a family that was distantly connected with the mother
of Miss McAuley. Her foster-parents, although very
worthy people, were bitterly prejudiced against the religion
practiced by their adopted child. They were so opposed
to anything Catholic that they would not permit a
crucifix or a pious picture in the house. Despite this, Catherine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
attended to her religious duties with great regularity
and fidelity, and by her gentleness succeeded in disarming
any anger or annoyance that they might have otherwise
felt regarding her course.</p>

<p>She was a model of all the virtues, and this fact did
not escape the attention of her foster-parents. Dean Gaffney,
writing of her at this period, says: “Everyone who
had distress to be relieved, affliction to be mitigated, troubles
to be encountered, came to her, and to the best of her
ability she advised them what to do. Her zeal made her
a missionary in her district.” In these works of charity
and usefulness she continued for several years, during
which she was rendering herself dearer and dearer to her
adopted parents. In the course of a few years both these
estimable people died, but not before the gentle foster-child
had led both of them into the Catholic Church. Catherine
was left the sole heiress of Mr. Callahan, and at once made
arrangements for systematically distributing food and
clothing to the poor.</p>

<p>Miss McAuley was now in a position to realize her
early vision of founding an institution in which servants
and other women of good character might, when out of
work, find a temporary home and be shielded from the
dangers to which the unprotected members of the sex are
exposed. She unfolded her plans to the Very Rev. Dr.
Armstrong and Very Rev. Dr. Blake, her spiritual advisers.</p>

<p>“It was deemed advisable,” says Dean Murphy, writing
of this, “not to take a house already built and occupied
for other purposes, and which she would have some difficulty
in adapting to her own designs, but to secure a plot
of ground that had never been built upon, and to erect an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
edifice for the honor and glory of God that had never been
profaned by the vices and folly of the world, and which
should be as holy in its creation as in its use, and be dedicated
to God from its very foundation.” The building was
constructed and put into operation within a reasonably
short time. When finished it was discovered that the architect
had created a building which for all purposes could
be used as a convent.</p>

<p>This was regarded as a fortunate mistake. In the beginning
Miss McAuley had no thought of founding a religious
institute, but in working out the ideas that were
near to her heart she imperceptibly and almost unconsciously
drifted towards that end. Daniel O’Connell, the
great Irish liberator, was a friend and patron of Miss McAuley,
and frequently visited her establishment, which he
regarded as filling a long-felt want in the Irish capital. In
1827 O’Connell presided over a Christmas dinner given by
Miss McAuley to the poor children of Dublin.</p>

<p>In 1828, at the suggestion of the Archbishop of the
Diocese, she formed the Order of the Sisters of Mercy.
There had been a “Royal, Military and Religious Order of
Our Lady of Mercy,” dating back to the twelfth century,
and this new order, founded by a pious young woman, was
largely based upon the old one, except that it was intended
for women and not for men. Miss McAuley frequently
said that what she desired was to found an order whose
members would combine the silence, recollection and prayer
of the Carmelite with the active zeal of a Sister of
Charity. It seems to be generally conceded that she succeeded
in achieving her purpose. Three words, “works
of mercy,” briefly tell the story of the character of the labors
of the Sisters of Mercy. Miss McAuley did not finally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
complete her laudable plan without having to overcome
many obstacles, and to set aside some very bitter opposition,
part of which came, not only from her own relatives,
but from bishops and priests as well.</p>

<p>A few years after the dedication of her institute Miss
McAuley and a few chosen companions decided that the
high purpose to which they had consecrated their lives
could be carried out if they would enter the religious
state. They were admitted to one of the convents of the
Presentation Order, and after a novitiate lasting one
year she and her companions received the religious
habit.</p>

<p>In October, 1831, she professed and was canonically
appointed by the Archbishop as Superior of the new order.
The costume worn by the members of the order was devised
by Mother Catherine, as she was thereafter called.
The Order grew rapidly in numbers and in prominence.
The life of its first Mother and foundress was active and
edifying. Her labors were not confined to any particular
work, but embraced everything that was in the interest
and for the benefit of the poor and unfortunate. In 1832
she won enduring laurels by assuming charge of the cholera
hospital in Dublin.</p>

<p>She died on November 11, 1837, resigned and happy,
and furnished an example of pious fortitude to the Sisters
that crowded about her deathbed. The Order that she
founded, as it exists to-day, is her best monument. Beginning
in Ireland in 1827 it was afterwards successfully introduced
into England, Newfoundland, Australia, New
Zealand, South America and the United States of America.

CLERICAL VETERANS.</h3>

<p>Notre Dame, Indiana, enjoys the distinction of a
Grand Army Post composed of Catholic clergymen, most
of whom are members of the faculty of Notre Dame University.
The organization was officially entered on October
6, 1897, as Post No. 569, Department of Indiana.
Very Rev. William E. Corby, C. S. C., the commander of
the new post, was chaplain of the Irish Brigade, and is
now the provincial, or head officer, of the order of the Holy
Cross in the United States. Dr. Corby is also the chaplain
of the Indiana Commandery of the Loyal Legion. To
this position he was nominated by General Lew Wallace.</p>

<p>The membership of the new post will be very small,
but large enough to have a few famous fighters and great
men of the war. With the exception of Colonel William
E. Haynes, the only lay member, the post is composed altogether
of members of the congregation of the Holy Cross.
The following complete the roster:</p>

<p>Very Rev. William Corby, C. S. C., chaplain Eighty-eighth
New York Volunteers, Irish Brigade.</p>

<p>Rev. Peter P. Cooney, C. S. C., chaplain Thirty-fifth
Medina.</p>

<p>James McLain (Brother Leander), C. S. C., B Company,
Twenty-fourth United States Infantry.</p>

<p>William A. Olmsted, C. S. C., captain and lieutenant
colonel Second Infantry, New York Volunteers, colonel
Fifty-ninth New York Veteran Volunteers; brigadier general
by brevet, commandery First Brigade, Second Division,
Second Army Corps, Army of the Potomac.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>

<p>Mark A. Willis (Brother John Chrysostom, C. S. C.),
I Company, Fifty-fourth Pennsylvania Volunteers.</p>

<p>Nicholas A. Bath (Brother Cosmos, C. S. C.), D Company,
Second United States Artillery.</p>

<p>James Mantle (Brother Benedict, C. S. C.), A Company,
First Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery and Sixth
United States Cavalry.</p>

<p>John McInerny (Brother Eustathius, C. S. C.), H Company,
Eighty-third Ohio Volunteers.</p>

<p>Joseph Staley (Brother Agathus, C. S. C.), C Company,
Eighth Indiana Regulars.</p>

<p>Ignatz Mayer (Brother Ignatius, C. S. C.), C Company,
Seventy-fifth Pennsylvania Volunteers and One Hundred
and Fifty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers.</p>

<p>James C. Malloy (Brother Raphael, C. S. C.), B Company,
One Hundred and Thirty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers.</p>

<p>Colonel William E. Haynes.</p>

<p>General Olmsted, who is studying for the priesthood,
is much interested in the little gathering. He is justly
proud of the work of his men in the celebrated Hancock’s
Division. He refers to the Government reports in every
case as proof of the bravery of his soldiers. The General
said not long ago in an interview: “Very much that is
said of me is not true, but to show you that my men were
brave, I give you the reports from the department at
Washington.” The General read: “The losses of the First
Brigade, Second Division, Second Corps&mdash;my brigade&mdash;were
greater in the battle of Gettysburg than those that
occurred to any one brigade in the army. There was, beside,
a total casualty of 763 killed and wounded out of 1246
men at Antietam, a percentage of 61.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span></p>

<p>Father Corby has the honor of being the only chaplain
to give absolution under fire. The event of his giving
absolution at Gettysburg to the Irish Brigade is the best
known of his achievements in chaplain life. It is said that
every man, Catholic and Protestant, knelt before the rock
upon which he stood, and the colors were lowered. Then
they went out and fought, and how many fell upon that
bloody field is too well known to be repeated. Father
Corby, although an old man, is hale and hearty, and does
all his work as provincial of the order without the aid of a
secretary.</p>

<p>Rev. Peter Cooney also has a brilliant war record, but
he and Father Corby are by no means the only two who
went to war from Notre Dame. In all there were eight
priests who went forth to service as chaplains in the war.
Beside these Mother Mary Angela, a cousin of James G.
Blaine, went forth with a large number of Sisters to nurse
the wounded and care for the dying. To these also great
praise is due.</p>

<p>There was much enthusiasm in Notre Dame over the
organization exercises, and among those present or who
sent their congratulations were General Lew Wallace,
General Mulholland, of Philadelphia; Colonel J. A. Smith,
of Indianapolis; General J. A. Golden, of New York; General
William J. Sewall, Colonel R. S. Robertson, of Fort
Wayne; General J. A. Starburg, of Boston; Captain Florence
McCarthy, of New York; Captain Emil A. Dapper, of
Grand Rapids; Captain J. J. Abercrombie, of Chicago;
Department Commander James S. Dodge, with his full
staff. The G. A. R. post from Elkhart and two posts from
South Bend helped to muster in the clerical veterans.
Commendatory messages were also received from a large
number of posts and leaders in the G. A. R.

CATHOLICS IN THE WAR.</h3>

<p>St. Teresa’s Church, at the northeast corner of Broad
and Catherine streets, was temporarily used as a hospital
for wounded soldiers during the war. On July 4, 1897,
Rev. Joseph V. O’Connor, one of the eloquent priests of
the diocese of Philadelphia, delivered an address in this
church, relative to Catholics in the war. A score of
Grand Army posts attended the exercises, which were
also honored by the presence of the venerable Hugh
Lane, who has been pastor of the church during and
since the war. Father O’Connor’s address deserves a
place in this volume. He said:</p>

<p>“The sacred edifice in which you assemble is an appropriate
spot for religion and patriotism to meet, for
St. Teresa’s Church was for a time in the Civil War a
military hospital. The old railway station at Broad
and Prime streets was the rendezvous of the Union
troops from the North and East going to and from the
seat of war. The gleaming cross upon the church seemed
lifted in benediction over army after army marching
past. The poet Byron represents the forest of Ardennes
as weeping over the ‘unreturning brave’ of Waterloo,
but the sign of man’s redemption may have lifted up
many a Catholic soldier’s heart destined to be stilled in
the next battle. These walls, now bright with light and
color, have re-echoed the moans of the dying. The venerable
priest whose gracious presence lends dignity and
historic interest to this celebration prepared here many
a soldier for the last dread fight with death, the universal
conqueror. I seem to behold, mingling with your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
solid phalanx, the shadowy forms of the brave men who
were delivered from the storm and earthquake of battle
to breathe out their spirits here in the peace of the
sanctuary.</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to limit to the Catholic breast
that noble fire of the love of country, which with purifying
flame burned in the great heart of the nation when
war sounded the trumpet call to the children of the republic.
It is occasion that shows the man. Our
Civil War was an occasion that showed our Church.
The legislative code of England was disgraced,
even in Victoria’s reign by the calumny and the imbecility
of penal laws against Catholics. To be a Catholic was
to be a traitor. In vain did we appeal to history, which
crowns with laurels the brows of unnumbered Catholic
patriots and heroes in every land of the universal Church.
The Thundering Legion fought for the Roman Emperor,
who decreed its martyrdom. The fleet of Protestant England
was led against the Armada of Catholic Spain by
a Catholic in the service of a Queen who sent his fellow-religionists
to the stake on account of their faith.
The patriotism of the Catholic is motived by his religion.
It rises superior to the form in which civil government
may be embodied. Were the Pope, as temporal prince,
to invade our country we should be bound in conscience
to repel him, nor would our patriotism conflict one iota
with our religious faith.</p>

<p>“Our people, driven by misgovernment from their
native soil, found the portals of the great Republic flung
open to them in friendly welcome. They came to the
North and to the West. Thus the great centres of
industry in the Northern States were crowded with
Catholics. Most of us had learned the bitter lessons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
which tyranny, bad government and religious
rancor have to impart under the scourge of England’s
misrule of Ireland. As Bourke Cockran says, England’s
treatment of the Irish people has made the world distrust
her. Ireland’s love for America dates from before
the Revolution. The Irish Parliament passed resolutions
of sympathy with the American colonists. The
great tides of immigration from Ireland set in early and
continued until, at the outbreak of the Civil War, the
North was one-fourth Celtic in blood.</p>

<p>“The Catholic Church studiously refrained from any
official pronouncement upon the causes of the conflict
which she deplored. The first regiment to respond to
President Lincoln’s initial call for troops was the Sixty-ninth
New York. It was mainly Irish and Catholic.
Within forty-eight hours it was on its way to the front.
New York, pre-eminently a Catholic State, furnished one-seventh
of the military forces in the war for the Union.</p>

<p>“Obviously the Government had no reason for recording
the religious faith of its soldiers. Patriotism is
at once a natural and a civic virtue. That it may be
supernaturalized is evident from the words of St. Paul,
bidding us obey the higher powers for conscience sake.
The country had to face a condition, not a theory, and
whatever abstract reasoning has to say about State
rights, the will of the majority of the people, which is
the supreme law in a republic, decided for the maintenance
of the Federal Union. The best traditions of the
country, North and South, identified liberty with union.
God appears to have made the country one in geographical
formation, in sameness of language, in homogeneity
of character.</p>

<p>“Two illustrious Catholic prelates, recognized as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
leaders in Israel&mdash;the Moses and the Joshua of the
Church&mdash;Archbishop Kendrick, of Baltimore, and Archbishop
Hughes, of New York, declared in favor of the
Union. The sainted sage of the primatial city
flung the starry banner from the pinnacle of
his Cathedral. The Archbishop of New York was so
thoroughly identified with the cause of the Union that
he was invested by the President and his Secretary of
State with the authority of envoy extraordinary to the
courts of Europe.</p>

<p>“Unroll the military records of our country and you
will read column after column of names that are historically
Catholic. Read the names on the tombstones of
soldiers in the great national cemeteries and you will
find in the Christian name alone confirmatory evidence
of the faith of the hero that sleeps beneath. The Catholic
knows that the Church imposes in baptism the name
of a saint. We may safely judge that he is a Catholic
who bears the name of Patrick and Michael, of Bernard
and Dominic. Not even the conservative spirit of the
Church of England could retain the old saintly nomenclature,
and Puritanism chose the names of Old Testament
worthies or names taken from natural history and
even heathen mythology.</p>

<p>“If we reckon our soldiers by their religion, the
majority would be Catholic and we should find that we
had given our children in far greater number than any
one denomination. On the second day of Gettysburg a
Catholic priest, ascending an eminence, lifted his hand
to give absolution, and far as the eye could reach rank
upon rank of soldiers bent their heads like cornfields
swept by the summer breeze. Hancock, the “superb,”
impressed by the solemnity of the scene, bared his brow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
If the poet thought that a tear should fall for Stonewall
Jackson because he spared Barbara Frietchie’s
Union flag, will not a Catholic murmur a prayer for the
great general who gave heed to the priest calling upon
his people to be contrite for their sins in the hour which
for many would be the last?</p>

<p>“The seven successive stormings of the heights of
Fredericksburg by the Irish Brigade has long passed into
history as surpassing Alma and the Sedan. Keenan’s
cavalry charge at Chancellorsville saved the Union
army at the cost of 300 lives. The charge of the Light
Brigade at Balaklava was described by a French officer
as magnificent, but unmilitary&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘C’est magnifique, mais
ce n’est pas la guerre.’</span> But Keenan’s charge was both
glorious and strategic. His troop rushed like a whirlwind
upon 20,000 Confederates. His men were shot down
or sabered in the saddle. The steeds, maddened by
wounds and uncontrolled by their dead riders, plunged
into the thick of the Confederate ranks, and so disconcerted
and appalled them that the main army of the
Union had time to save itself from otherwise inevitable
destruction. Perhaps the most critical point of the war
was the success or the failure of Sheridan’s devastation
of the Shenandoah Valley, which was the great base of
supplies for the South. Sheridan’s historic ride, which
saved the day at Winchester, was the exploit of a Catholic.
The Republic subsequently conferred upon this son
of the Church one of the highest and most responsible
positions in her keeping, the generalship of her armies.</p>

<p>“One of the first, if not the first band of trained
nurses that offered their services to the Government was
the religious society of the Sisters of Charity. Their
title is their history. Their services in hospitals and on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
the field did more than tomes of controversy to
make the Catholic Church better known, and consequently
loved, by the American people. The convalescing soldier
by word and by letter spread the information
throughout the land that the ministrations of the Catholic
Sisterhood reminded him of a mother’s love and a
sister’s tenderness.</p>

<p>“The heroic devotion to duty of the Catholic chaplains,
who made no distinction of religion when a soldier
was to be helped, endeared the Catholic religion to
many who met a Catholic priest for the first time in
camp or hospital. Our own noble-hearted Archbishop
rendered such service to the wounded soldiers in St.
Louis that the Government offered him a chaplaincy.
Care of the body was often supplemented with the
higher care of the soul. In that parting hour, when
mortality leans upon the breast of religion, the example
of devoted priest and religious gently led many a soul
into the hope and the consolation of divine faith.</p>

<p>“God grant that our country shall never again reel
under the shock of war! Yet out of the nettle of danger
has come the flower of safety. Calumny, suspicion,
distrust of our patriotism were struck dumb. Never
again shall we be taunted with secret antipathy to free
institutions. The banner of the stars was rebaptized
in our blood. To the soldier of the war the Church owes
a debt of gratitude. He proved often by his death that
the religion which he professed, far from condemning his
patriotism, commended it as a virtue, and the faith that
sustained him in battle supported him when his heart
poured out the blood of supreme sacrifice upon the altar
of his country. And though no memorial marks his
resting place the Church in every mass pleads for the
repose of his soul.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

<p>“The soldier stands as the highest value which we
place upon our country and her institutions. He says to
all: ‘My country is worth dying for.’ In our thoughtless
way we take liberty, security of life and property, the
blessings of religion and safeguards of law and all the
beauty and amenity of our civilization as a matter of
course. Without the soldier all these goods would perish.
It is war that preserves and protects peace. The
soldier is the guardian of our homes. Honor him; make
peaceful and happy his declining years. Thank God with
David for preparing our hands for the sword, before
whose blinding ray, in the hand of the hero, domestic
treason and foreign conspiracy slink into their dens.
Bless God for making us a nation of soldiers, as well
as of citizens. The war proved that the American soldier,
North and South, is without a peer in bravery, in
discipline, in self-control. Whilst our Republic gives
birth to such heroic sons we may laugh armed Europe to
scorn.</p>

<p>“Soldiers, there is another battle, another field, a
greater Captain than even the archangel who led the
embattled seraphim to war. You divine my meaning.
Be soldiers of the cross! Fight the good fight of faith.
Be sober, pure, charitable. The laurel that binds the
warrior’s brow on earth soon fades. The flowers of
Decoration Day droop with the setting sun. But the
Divine Captain of our salvation will place upon your
brow, if you are faithful to the end, a crown that fadeth
not away, a wreath which you will receive amid the
shout of the heavenly armies.”

THE SANITARY COMMISSION.</h3>

<p>The purpose of the writer of this history, as already
stated, has been to furnish for the first time a full and
detailed story of the labors of the Catholic Sisterhoods
in the Civil War, but in doing that he has not had the
slightest intention of detracting from the splendid service
rendered by other bodies and other persons. One
of the most notable organizations that contributed its
part in the humane work incident to the war was the
Sanitary Commission. It had its rise in a spontaneous
movement of the women in New England. It is said
that 7000 branch Aid Societies were connected with the
Commission at one time. Charles J. Stille, of Philadelphia,
has written a history of the Commission, from
which most of the facts embodied in this sketch have
been obtained. Committees were sent to Washington,
the part of the Government, the Secretary of War, on
the 9th of June, 1861, issued an order appointing Henry
and after much negotiation, involving tedious delay on
W. Bellows, D. D., Professor A. D. Boche, LL. D., Professor
Jeffries Wyman, M. D., W. H. Van Buren, M. D.,
Wolcott Gibbs, M. D., R. C. Wood, surgeon U. S. A.; G.
W. Cullom, U. S. A.; Alexander E. Shiras, U. S. A., in
connection with such others as they might chose to associate
with them, “a commission of inquiry and advice in
respect of the sanitary interests of the United States
forces.” They were to serve without remuneration from
the Government and were to be provided with a room
for their use in the city of Washington.</p>

<p>They were to direct their inquiries to the principles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
and practices connected with the inspection of recruits
and enlisted men, the sanitary condition of volunteers,
to the means of preserving and restoring the health and
of securing the general comfort and efficiency of the
troops, to the proper provision of cooks, nurses and hospitals,
and to other subjects of a like nature. The mode
by which they proposed to conduct these inquiries was
detailed in the letter of the New York delegation to the
Secretary of War on the 22d of May. The order appointing
them directed that they should correspond
freely with the department and with the Medical Bureau
concerning these subjects, and on this footing and within
these limits their relations with the official authorities
were established. To enable them to carry out fully
the purposes of their appointment the Surgeon General
issued a circular letter announcing the creation of the
Commission, and directing all the officers in his department
to grant its agents every facility in the prosecution
of their duties.</p>

<p>On the 12th of June the gentlemen named as Commissioners
in the order of the Secretary of War (with
the exception of Professor Wyman, who had declined his
appointment) assembled at Washington. They proceeded
to organize the Board by the selection of the
Rev. Dr. Bellows as president. Their first care was to
secure the services of certain gentlemen as colleagues,
who were supposed to possess special qualifications, but
whose names had not been included in the original warrant.
Accordingly Dr. Elisha Harris and Dr. Cornelius
R. Agnew were unanimously chosen Commissioners at
the first meeting, and George T. Strong and Dr. J. S.
Newberry in like manner at the one next succeeding.
At different periods during the war Rt. Rev. Bishop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
Clark, Hon. R. W. Burnet, Hon. Mark Skinner, Hon. Joseph
Holt, Horace Binney, Jr., Rev. J. H. Heywood, Prof.
Fairman Rogers, J. Huntingdon Wolcott, Charles J.
Stille, E. B. McCagg and F. Law Olmstead were elected
by the Board members of the Commission.</p>

<p>At the first meeting a “Plan of Organization,” prepared
by the president, was presented, discussed and finally
adopted. On the 13th the Commission, in a body, waited
on the President and Secretary of War, who gave their
formal sanction to this plan of organization by affixing
to it their signatures. The experiences of the war suggested
but little alteration, even in the outline of this
report, while to a strict adherence to the general principles
it embodied the Sanitary Commission owed much
of its wonderful success.</p>

<p>The plan reduced to a practical system and method
the principles laid down in the letters of the New York
gentlemen to the Government authorities and endeavored
to apply them to the actual existing condition of
the army. Confining its proposed operations within the
limited sphere of “inquiry” and “advice,” which had been
assigned to it by the Government, it declared what it
proposed to do and by what methods in each of these departments
of duty.</p>

<p>In order that its work might be carried on systematically
and thoroughly two general committees were created,
one respecting “inquiry,” the other “advice.” The
object of the first was to determine by all the light
which could be derived from experience what must necessarily
be the wants and conditions of troops brought together
as ours had been, to ascertain exactly how far
evils which had proved the scourge of other armies had
already invaded our own, and to decide concerning the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
best measures to be adopted to remove all causes of removable
and preventable disease.</p>

<p>Each branch of “inquiry” under this head was referred
to a distinct sub-committee. From the first was
expected such suggestions of preventable measures as
experience in former wars had proved to be absolutely
essential; to the second was entrusted the actual inspection,
by its own members or their agents, of the camps
and hospitals, so that the real condition of the army, in
a sanitary point of view, concerning which there were
many conflicting rumors, could be definitely known. To
the third was referred all questions concerning the improvement
of the health and efficiency of the army in respect
to diet, clothing, quarters and matters of a similar
nature.</p>

<p>In regard to the other branch of duty assigned to
the Commission under its appointment, that of “advice,”
the Board took the same wide and comprehensive views
as had guided them in regard to the needful subjects
of inquiry. Their purpose was to “get the opinions and
conclusions of the Commission approved by the Medical
Bureau, ordered by the War Department and carried out
by the officers and men.”</p>

<p>The interest excited in thousands of homes throughout
the land, whose inmates were members of aid societies
in favor of the Sanitary Commission, and who
looked upon it only as the almoner of their vast offerings
for the relief of the army, led to the popular error that
it was only a relief association upon a grand scale and
quite overshadowed in popular estimation its original
purpose, if not the peculiar and exclusive work before it.
The Commission itself, however, never departed from the
true scientific idea and conception of a preventive system,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
and always regarded the relief system, vast as was
the place occupied by it in the war, as inferior in the
importance of its results to those due to well considered
and thoroughly executed preventive measures.</p>

<p>The Commission at the close of the war established
a pension bureau and war claim agency for the benefit of
disabled soldiers and their orphans and widows. The
entire money receipts of the Commission from 1861 to
1866 were $4,924,480.99, and the value of supplies furnished
is estimated at $15,000,000.</p>

A MIRACLE OF THE WAR.</h3>

<p>The following interesting little incident is taken
from Very Rev. W. C. Corby’s book, entitled “Memoirs of
Chaplain Life:”</p>

<p>“On the 29th of November, 1863,” says Rev. Constantine
L. Egan, O. P., chaplain of the Ninth Massachusetts
Volunteers, “we advanced to Mine Run and
formed a line of battle and bivouacked for the night.
The enemy were posted on the east ridge, about one
mile from the stream called Mile Run, on a centre ridge
nearly 100 feet above the surface of the stream. Their
works could easily be seen by us posted on the west
ridge of the run. They were strongly fortified, their
works bristling with abatis, infantry parapets and epaulements
for batteries. About 3 o’clock on the evening
of the 30th the order was given to charge the enemy’s
line. Seeing the danger of death before us I asked the
colonel to form his regiment into a solid square so that
I could address the men. He did so. I then spoke to
them of their danger, and entreated them to prepare
for it by going on their knees and making a sincere act
of contrition for their sins, with the intention of going
to confession if their lives were spared.</p>

<p>“As the regiment fell on their knees, other Catholic
soldiers broke from their ranks and joined us, so that
in less than two minutes I had the largest congregation
I ever witnessed before, or even since. Having pronounced
the words of general absolution to be given in
such emergencies and danger, I spoke a few words of
encouragement to them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<p>* * * “After talking to the soldiers and finishing
my remarks, they arose from their knees, grasping
their muskets with a firm clinch, and went back to
their respective commands, awaiting the hour to expire
to make the assault.”</p>

<p>Smith Johnson, taking this as his theme, has written
the following poem, entitled “A Miracle of War,”
and dedicated it to Father Corby:</p>

LINCOLN AT GETTYSBURG.</h3>

<p>It has been aptly said that the battlefield of Gettysburg
has become the “Mecca of American Reconciliation.”
By act of Congress a National Park has been established
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
there, observatories erected and everything
possible done to make the battlefield convenient and attractive
to tourists.</p>

<p>The National Cemetery at Gettysburg was dedicated
November 19, 1863. The oration was by Edward Everett.
On this occasion President Lincoln made the famous
address that will never die. It was as follows:</p>

<p>“Four-score and seven years ago our fathers brought
forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
created equal. Now, we are engaged in a great civil war,
testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived
and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a
great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field as a final resting place for those
who here gave their lives that the nation might
live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do
this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate&mdash;we
cannot consecrate&mdash;we cannot hallow this ground. The
brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have
consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.
The world will little note nor long remember what
we say here, but it never can forget what they did here.
It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the
unfinished work which they who fought here have thus
far so nobly carried on. It is rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us&mdash;that
from these honored dead we take increased devotion to
that cause for which they gave the last full measure of
devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead
shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom; and that the government
of the people, by the people, and for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.”

<h3 id="The_Faith_and_the_Flag">XIX.<br />

THE FAITH AND THE FLAG.</h3>

<p>While the work of the zealous Catholic Sisterhoods
on the battlefield and in the camp and hospital was for
humanity in its broadest sense the effect of their example
and the beauty of their daily lives also had the effect
of clearing away the mists of prejudice that sometimes
distorted and clouded the views of honorable, well-meaning
and worthy non-Catholics. The writer has endeavored
to present the history of the labors of the Sisters
in a straightforward and dispassionate manner.</p>

<p>He has dealt exclusively in facts and has, as far as
possible, avoided comment. It has especially been his
aim to keep entirely clear of sectional disputes or religious
controversies. Hence it will be found that the story
of the work of the Sisters has reference, in the main, to
their devotion to suffering humanity. It was inevitable,
however, that men living in the atmosphere of sanctity
created by these good women should feel the consoling
benefit of their silent influence. The result was that
non-Catholics began to take a broader and more kindly
view of their Catholic comrades and fellow-citizens, and
long before the war closed they realized that the faith
and the flag were entirely compatible.</p>

<p>A few years ago William J. Onahan, of Chicago, in
an address, incidentally touched upon this very point.
Speaking of those who were distrustful of the Church
and its teachings he said: “If they could realize the harmony
and benevolent influence of her teaching, the number
of souls redeemed through her efforts and graces
from despair and sin, the wounded hearts solaced by her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
balm&mdash;the extent of human misery she has removed or
mitigated? Let them but think how that Church has
consecrated the marriage tie, sanctified the home, shielded
the unfortunate, lifted up the lowly and sorrow-stricken,
staying the arm of the oppressor, pleading for
the rights of the poor against the power of the tyrant and
the greed of capital. Witness the asylums and the
refuges the Catholic Church has established all over the
world for every condition of infirmity and suffering&mdash;for
the orphans, the foundlings, the sick, the aged, the wayward
and the fallen.</p>

<p>“See the admirable sisterhoods&mdash;to which no
parallel can be found on earth&mdash;the Sisters of
Charity and Mercy, the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ,
the Sisters of St. Joseph, the nuns of the Good Shepherd,
the Little Sisters of the Poor and countless others,
varying in the admirable diversity of their charitable labors.
Watch these sisters at their appointed duties in
the hospitals and asylums, in the hovels of the poor, by
the bedside of the dying&mdash;aye, in pesthouses and smallpox
hospitals, as well as on the battlefield, ministering to
the dying soldier&mdash;all bent on doing God’s work for
God’s sake. Assuredly these facts&mdash;these daily examples
here before our eyes, within reach of our feet in
daily walk&mdash;assuredly these ought to serve toward dispelling
the false glare of prejudice.</p>

<p>“As a preliminary let me say I adopt without reserve
or qualification the language of the Baltimore Catholic
Congress: ‘We rejoice at the marvellous development of
our country, and regard with just pride the part taken
by Catholics in such development.’ In the words of the
pastoral issued by the Archbishops of the United States,
assembled in the third Plenary Council of Baltimore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
‘we claim to be acquainted both with the laws, institutions
and spirit of our country, and we emphatically declare
that there is no antagonism between them.</p>

<p>“We repudiate with equal earnestness the assertion
that we need to lay aside any of our devotedness to our
Church to be true Americans, and the insinuations that
we need abate any of our love for our country’s principles
to be faithful Catholics. We believe that our country’s
heroes were the instruments of the God of Nations in
establishing this home of freedom; to both the Almighty
and to His instruments in the work we look with grateful
reverence, and to maintain the inheritance of freedom
which they have left us, should it ever&mdash;which God
forbid&mdash;be imperiled, our Catholic citizens will be bound
to stand forward as one man, ready to pledge anew
their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor.’</p>

<p>“Before turning to the question of the ‘rights and
duties’ let me first define what I understand by the term
‘Catholic Citizen.’ An American citizen, whether by
birth or adoption, who, having had the grace of Christian
baptism, believes and practices the teachings of the
Catholic Church&mdash;in other words a practical Catholic.
Now we come to the question of ‘rights and duties.’
What are our rights as citizens? No more, no less, precisely,
than those possessed by any other American citizen.
What are the rights we in common have with others?
In general terms we have the ‘right’ of enjoying
and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing
and protecting property and reputation and of pursuing
our own happiness.</p>

<p>“We hold, in the language of the Constitution
of Illinois, that all men have a natural and
indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
the dictates of their own consciences, that no man can of
right be compelled to attend, erect or support any place
of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent,
that no human authority can in any case whatever
control or interfere with the rights of conscience. We
have a right to be protected in our persons and property;
we cannot be deprived of either without due process of
law; the right of free elections, to trial by jury, to equality
before the law&mdash;but I need not enter into detail of
the ‘Bill of Rights’ which specifies the catalogue of a
freeman’s inheritance. The highest and most precious
right, however, is that of religious freedom, liberty to
worship God without let or hindrance and free from religious
disabilities of any kind, and next to their own
rights as free men, to exercise it as shall best promote
the welfare of the city, State and nation.</p>

<p>“Catholics, then, are entitled to absolute equality before
the law, and this is according to the letter and spirit
of the Constitution of the United States, as well as of
the several States now, I believe, without exception.
There is nevertheless an unwritten law, which operates
as a practical discrimination against Catholics in public
life as effectually as though it were so expressed in the
Constitution. It is the law of public opinion deriving its
force and effect from popular prejudice. It is a well-known
fact that neither of the great political parties
would dare to nominate a Catholic for the Presidency,
and the same is true as to the office of Governor in the
different States. Surely it would not be claimed that
no American Catholic could be found qualified by position
and ability for any of these high offices.</p>

<p>“Eternal vigilance, it has been said, is the
price of liberty. Probably if Catholics were alert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
in asserting their rights&mdash;in a just and lawful,
as well as in a reasonable manner&mdash;there would
be less disposition shown to infringe upon
those rights, and to ignore their claim to representation.
Again, the government, whether National or State, has
no just claim or authority to deny the rights of conscience
to Catholics, whether they be employed in the
service of the nation, in the army or naval forces, in penal
or reformatory institutions, in asylums, or elsewhere.
The State may lawfully and justly deprive a man of his
liberty and place him behind prison bars; but it has no
right to compel him while there to attend a form of religious
worship in which he does not believe; it should
not deny or hamper the attendance and ministrations of
priest or elder whose services are sought by the prisoner
or State’s own ward. Justice and sound policy alike
demonstrate the wisdom of invoking the services of the
Catholic Missionary for Catholics, whether in jail or asylum,
or on the frontier.</p>

<p>“General Grant testified that Father De Smet’s
presence among the Indians was of greater value
to the Government than a regiment of cavalry,
and recent events on our Northern borders intensify
the force of this conclusion. The Catholic missionary
is always a peacemaker. Catholics ask nothing in the
way of ‘privileges.’ We have no claim to privileges. We
only ask what we are willing to concede to others&mdash;equality
and fair play. If others are content to minimize
religious principles or to abdicate them entirely we must
be excused if we insist on holding fast to ours. We are
on firm ground in that respect; we do not care to follow
others into the “slough of despond.” We are persuaded
that every vexed question occupying and disturbing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
public attention, dividing and distracting the people can
be amicably adjusted, provided the wise men of the nation
and the States will take these questions out of the
hands of fanatics and bigots, who are only too eager and
anxious to inaugurate a reign of discord and religious
strife.</p>

<p>“Catholics, be assured, will have no part in this warfare,
beyond protecting and defending their rights&mdash;God-given
and Constitutional rights. They would be unworthy
of American citizenship were they to be content
with less.</p>

<p>“We now come to the question of the ‘Duties of
Catholics as Citizens.’ Let it be understood that in undertaking
to answer this, as well as the previous question
under consideration, I speak for myself only as a
Catholic layman. I express my own thoughts and convictions
unreservedly. What are the ‘duties’ referred
to? First, and primarily, I should say to be American,
in all that the term broadly implies. How do I define
the term American? It stands in my mind for liberty,
order, education and opportunities. It is the duty of the
Catholic citizen to love liberty for its own sake, order for
the general good and to illustrate the highest type and
model of civic virtue. It is a duty to foster and nourish
the purity of home life and the domestic virtues, eagerly
to promote education and to make every necessary sacrifice
for it, and to see to it that Catholic children shall
have the benefit of a sound Christian education. Catholics
should avail themselves of the material opportunities
and advantages offered in this wonderful age and country,
and strive to be in the front ranks in the march of
progress.</p>

<p>“The field is wide and inviting, the race is open
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
to all. The privilege of American citizenship should be
regarded as precious and priceless. Because so easily
acquired, perhaps, it is not sufficiently estimated at its
true value and worth. Think what American citizenship
confers; see what it assures! Equal part and membership
in this mighty empire&mdash;the equal advantage in its
unsurpassed opportunities&mdash;the unqualified privileges of
its unequaled freedom. No standing armies here to be
moved at a monarch’s caprice, weighing down and oppressing
the nation’s energies, draining it of its life blood,
sapping its vitality, and, worst evil of all, menacing the
peace of the world. No armed ‘constabulary’ to terrorize
over a peasant population and enforce the heartless
edict of brutal landlords. No hereditary or favored
classes. No obstacle to the unfettered enjoyment of
those rights which we possess from God in the natural
law, and that are guaranteed to us in the Constitution
and laws of the land&mdash;the right to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>“What a future opens before us, what possibilities
for ourselves and for our children! Justly are the American
people jealous of this inheritance. It must be
guarded with vigilant care, lest unworthy hands and
evil guidance should put it in peril. American liberty and
the opportunities of American life are too precious to
the human family to permit the one and the other to be
wrecked or endangered. I rejoice in every indication of
patriotic public spirit, whether shown in devotion and
respect for the country’s flag or in reverence and admiration
for the nation’s heroes. We need all these demonstrations
to keep alive in this material age the ardor
and purity of true patriotism.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>

<p>“True American patriotism is the inheritance
and monopoly of no one class or condition. Its
title is not derived from accident of birth or color,
is not to be determined by locality. Montgomery,
Pulaski, Steuben, De Kalb, Rochambeau, the Moylans
and Sullivans, fought for American liberty in the
Revolutionary days with an ardor and a fidelity at least
equal to that displayed by those “native and to the manner
born.” Jackson was none the less a typical American
because of the accident of his father’s foreign birth,
or, as is sometimes intimated, of his own. And who
shall question the patriotic devotion of General Shields,
honorably identified with the early history of your own
State; of Meagher, of Mulligan, of Sheridan, of Meade
and countless others I might name.</p>

<p>“Apprehension is sometimes expressed at the growth
of foreign influence and the display of foreign customs,
but this fear is after all puerile. Under our system of
government the foreigner who comes to stay is soon assimilated,
and while there may be here and there instances
and examples, the outgrowth of foreign habits
and customs, not welcome to American notions, yet these
can be only passing and temporary accidents. The
foreigner, I insist, is all right, provided he is loyal to
American laws and government. We have no use for
any other.”

<h3 id="A_Romance_of_the_War">XX.<br />

A ROMANCE OF THE WAR.</h3>

<p>This record of their life and conduct could not be
brought to a more appropriate close than by the recital
of a touching romance of the war, growing directly out
of the work of the Sisters during that crucial period.
The episode upon which the story hinges gains added
interest from the fact that it constituted one of the actual
occurrences of the closing day of the war.</p>

<p>A few years before the first shot was fired upon
Sumter a household that was a perfect picture of domestic
felicity existed in one of the large cities of Kentucky.
It consisted of four persons&mdash;father, mother,
son and daughter. The parents were in comfortable circumstances,
and in their life and conduct were all that
the heads of a Christian family should be. The son and
daughter vied with one another in performing those little
acts of devotion and duty that go so far toward making
up the sum total of harmony and happiness that should
ever reign about the family hearthstone.</p>

<p>At the time our narrative begins the son was approaching
his twentieth year. He was a tall, handsome
manly fellow, and by a course of preparatory work was
now about to begin the final years of study at the West
Point Military Academy. The daughter, a girl of unusual
intelligence and beauty, was two years the junior
of her brother. Hers was a devout nature, and choice
and study led her to adopt the habit of a Sister of
Charity as the means for carrying out a desire to be both
useful and good during her transitory stay upon this
earth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span></p>

<p>Just at this period death, by one of these inexplicable
strokes which can never be made quite clear to the
human intellect, carried off both parents. The devoted
children of such a loving father and mother were naturally
prostrated at such an affliction. But they rallied
nobly, and grief only served to bring out the better qualities
of their nature. After all that was mortal of their
dearest ones had been consigned to the earth they calmly
sat down and rationally discussed their future plans.</p>

<p>The result was just what might have been expected.
Both resolved to carry out their original design. The
parting was a sad one&mdash;the man going to complete his
knowledge of a soldier’s life&mdash;the woman to her convent
home to receive the final vows and to learn the last
lessons concerning the philosophy of charity in its sweetest
and grandest sense.</p>

<p>Many years passed and the brother and sister, in their
widely separated and totally different spheres of life,
were as dead to one another as if they had never lived
under the same roof. The Civil War with all of its horrors
began. What had been the theoretical discussions
of cabinets and the political orations of legislators now
developed into the fierce and awful reality of war. It
was no longer a question of what might or could have
been, the actual grim-visaged monster with all of the
hideous ills that follow was engaged in the work of
death and destruction.</p>

<p>Men volunteered their services. After them came the
nurses. One of these was Sister S&mdash;&mdash;, from one of the
Northern houses of the Sisters of Charity. In order to
expedite her mission of mercy it was necessary that she
should enter the service of the Federal Government.
The record of her daily life from that time forth was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
record of every member of the Catholic Sisterhood that
served during the war. Days of uninterrupted work;
nights of ceaseless watching.</p>

<p>Soon after the siege of Vicksburg word was telegraphed
to Baltimore that a corps of Sisters of Charity
was needed at once to care for the scores of sick and
wounded then suffering in Louisiana. Only five Sisters
were available. They were sent at once, with Sister S&mdash;&mdash;
in command. They found travel seriously impeded
from the start. This fact caused the good Samaritans
much anguish of mind, for the summons they received
said that many of the men would die unless they had
the immediate attendance of experienced nurses. When
the Sisters reached Chattanooga they found that a special
train had been provided for the purpose of rushing
them with all possible speed to the City of New Orleans.
On this train there were also a number of Union officers
carrying important sealed orders from the authorities at
Washington to the men in charge of the Union forces in
what was known as the “Department of the Gulf.” Sisters
and officers were filled with conflicting emotions, but
all had one object in common&mdash;the desire to reach New
Orleans at the earliest possible moment. With the Sisters
it was a race for life&mdash;for lives that might be saved
by their exertions. With the men it was a race for honor&mdash;for
promotion, perhaps for official commendation from
the General of the Army or the President of the United
States.</p>

<p>Finally the train steamed into the Crescent City,
and the officers went to seek their commanders and the
sisters their patients, who were in a small town on the
Mississippi River. Sister S&mdash;&mdash; divided her small force of
nurses with such rare good judgment and executive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
ability that in twenty-four hours all of the sick and
wounded men were resting comfortably. Suddenly came
the order to depart and the Union troops all left the town,
taking with them such of the convalescent patients as
were able to bear the strain of travel. Twelve hours
later a portion of the Confederate army entered the
town, bringing several hundred of their sick and wounded.
Sister S&mdash;&mdash;, thinking that the call to duty in this instance
was no less imperative than it had been in the
case of the Union men the day before, started for the hospital,
where the wounded Confederates had been carried.</p>

<p>One of the Union surgeons who had remained behind
with his wounded men, placed a detaining hand
upon her arm.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” he said.</p>

<p>“To look after these men,” she replied.</p>

<p>“That is impossible,” he said. “You are in the service
of the United States Government, and you are
are not permitted to serve under the enemy. We have
no objection to your nursing the wounded Confederates,
but it must be under the auspices of our generals. The
Union forces will probably regain possession of this
town before nightfall, and then you can wait upon both
sides alike.”</p>

<p>“But I insist,” and the eyes of the usually mild-mannered
Sister sparkled as she stamped her foot in an emphatic
manner. “I know nothing of technical military
rules, but I insist upon my right to nurse these poor
men.”</p>

<p>“I regret very much being placed in such a position,”
said the surgeon gently, “but I am here representing the
Government.”</p>

<p>“And I,” responded the Sister, “am here representing
something greater than the Government.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span></p>

<p>“What is that?” he asked in an incredulous tone.</p>

<p>“Humanity!” was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>The officer&mdash;a brave man obeying orders&mdash;did not
utter another word, but bowing his head opened the door
and admitted the Sister and her companions into the
presence of the sick.</p>

<p>Scarcely a minute had elapsed when the surgeon
heard the heartrending shriek of a woman come from the
interior of the building. Rushing in he beheld the Sister
kneeling beside a cot at the far end of the room. The
tears were pouring down her cheeks, but it was evident
that they were tears of joy. The bearded man upon the
cot was seriously wounded, but there was a placid expression
upon his countenance as he kissed the hands of
the Sister.</p>

<p>Need this dramatic scene be explained to the reader.
It was the son and daughter mentioned in the beginning
of this sketch&mdash;reunited after years of separation. The
one enlisted in the Confederate army, the other a nurse
serving under the Union Government. The sight drew
tears from rough soldiers who seldom betrayed emotion
of any character.</p>

<p>The Sister lavished every attention upon her wounded
brother. What would have been a solemn duty under
any conditions now became a work of love and affection.
But it was all in vain. He had been marked as a
a victim by the grim destroyer. In a few days he
breathed his last, edified and consoled by the presence of
his Sister and all of the offices of religion.</p>

<p>Funerals from the hospital always occurred at
night, and this was no exception. But the obsequies of
the young Confederate officer were out of the ordinary.
Every one about the hospital, and, indeed, in the town,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
evinced a desire to do something as a mark of respect to
Sister S&mdash;&mdash;. The moon was shining brightly on the night
of the interment, and it looked down upon a ghostly procession
that followed the body to its last resting place.
Six convalescent soldiers&mdash;three Union men and three
Confederates, acted as pall-bearers. The services of the
church were conducted by the chaplain. Sister S&mdash;&mdash; was
the chief mourner. The other sisters followed with
lighted tapers. No one took more interest in the proceedings
or did more for the convenience of those concerned
than the surgeon with whom the Sister had the
altercation a few days before. After the war the Sister
devoted herself to those works of charity and mercy,
which to a person with the desire and will are within
reach in times of peace as well as in times of war.

<h2 id="PUBLISHERS_NOTICE">PUBLISHER’S NOTICE.</h2>
<p class="table"><span style="font-size: x-small">⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯●⎯○⎯●⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯</span></p>

<p>No book on the war, that has been published in recent years, has
met with a more generous reception than has been accorded by the
reading public to the “Angels of the Battlefield.” Congratulations
and expressions of good-will have come from all classes of persons.
Following will be found brief comments from letters and from notices
of the secular and religious press. These references are in most cases
mere excerpts from lengthy reviews of the book. Of course it has
been impracticable to publish quotations from all of the newspapers, but
those that are given are of a representative character.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span></p>

<h4>Archbishop Ryan’s Eloquent and Earnest Letter of
Recommendation.</h4>

<p>I beg to thank you for the copy of your book, “Angels of the Battlefield,”
which you were kind enough to send to me. I have read it with
great satisfaction and beg to congratulate you on your success in presenting
the touching and edifying scenes in which Charity sent her
Angels into both camps alike, to heal the sick and console the dying, to
chasten triumph and comfort defeat.</p>

<p>The mission of these “Angels of the Battlefield” was to remove the
strong prejudices that impeded the progress of the Church. It was like
the mission of Saints Peter and John to the poor lame man at the porch
that was called beautiful of Solomon’s temple. The nation, wounded and
crippled by the war, was sent in through the beautiful gate of Catholic
charity to view the true temple of God. And of those who never belonged
to the fold of the Catholic Church how many can cry out with
honest Captain Jack Crawford, quoted by you. “My friends, I am not
a Catholic, but I stand ready at any and all times to defend these noble women,
even with my life, for I owe that life to them.”</p>

<p>I earnestly recommend your excellent book to all with whom my
opinion may have any influence.&mdash;Most Rev. P. J. Ryan, D. D., LL. D.,
Archbishop of Philadelphia.</p>

<h4>A Very Flattering Tribute from the Governor of
Pennsylvania.</h4>

<p>I am more than pleased with the work. It is a valuable addition to
our war literature. I cannot but recommend your subject matter and
approve of your literary style. I congratulate you heartily on the graceful
and deserved tribute to the women who served so faithfully and
loyally the cause of humanity during the dark days of our nation’s struggle.&mdash;Gen.
Daniel H. Hastings, Governor of Pennsylvania.</p>

<h4>High Praise from the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand
Army of the Republic.</h4>

<p>General J. P. S. Gobin, Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the
Republic, writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have at length had an opportunity to carefully read your volume,
“Angels of the Battlefield,” and wish to thank you for the pleasure you
have given me. Your book is a valuable addition to the literature of
the War. You have depicted those scenes with rare fidelity and without
exaggeration, which so frequently justified the title you have selected.&mdash;Very
truly yours, J. P. S. Gobin, Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<h4>Particularly Happy in Avoiding Sectional, Political or Religious
Controversies.</h4>

<p>There is a praiseworthy attempt to give plain facts without comment
or unnecessary coloring. The author has been particularly happy in avoiding
sectional, political or religious controversies. Although many volumes
have been written concerning the work of women in the war, this
book is said to be the first connected and consecutive history of the self-sacrificing
labors of the Catholic Sisterhoods during that great conflict.&mdash;The
Washington (D. C.) Post.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span></p>

<h4>Comment from the Official Organ of the Historical Society
of Quebec, Canada.</h4>

<p>As might be expected, the work is full of interest, and is an eloquent
tribute to the faith that produces such heroines. There was difficulty in
collecting the data for the genuine humility so characteristic of the Sisters
would move them to hide, rather than publish, the deeds, in themselves
so heroic, but in their eyes only what their duty, enlightened by faith
and enkindled by charity, demanded of them. In order to make the narrative
as consecutive as the scattered notes permitted, a sketchy account
of the war is introduced.&mdash;Le Courrier Du Livre, Quebec, Canada, official
organ of the Quebec Historical Society.</p>

<h4>Cordial Words from Right Rev. Edmond F. Prendergast, D. D.,
Auxiliary Bishop of Philadelphia.</h4>

<p>“I have read your beautiful work, ‘Angels of the Battlefield,’ from
beginning to end, with the greatest pleasure. It is certainly a most delightful
book, and I trust and hope that it will have readers everywhere.”&mdash;Right
Rev. Edmond F. Prendergast, D. D., Auxiliary Bishop of Philadelphia.</p>

<h4>General Miles, the Head of the Army, and the “Angels of the
Battlefield.”</h4>

<p>“Recently I had occasion to call on General Miles, the ranking officer
of the army, the Miles who gained such distinction as one of Hancock’s
fighting commanders. When I entered his office, at the War Department,
I found him reading a book in which he appeared to be deeply
interested. Having the curiosity which comes to newspaper men, both
by nature and from training, I could not restrain myself from asking the
General the name of the book. It proved to be “Angels of the Battlefield:
A History of the Catholic Sisterhoods in the War of the Rebellion,” a
work by a near friend and professional colleague of mine, Mr. George
Barton.&mdash;“S. M.” in Philadelphia Evening Star.</p>

<h4>The work possesses “the Light and Interest Which Belongs
to Incidents from Life.”</h4>

<p>The author has been able to gather from personal interviews with
Sisters many narratives which give to his pages the light and interest
which belong to incidents from life. He possesses the vivid sympathy
with action and suffering, without which a history of this kind would be
no better than dry bones. The author is rightly touched by the heroism
that surrounded those cots, where enemies lay side by side in an agony,
which, for many, could only obtain surcease in the grave. Some incidental
descriptions of battles are animated, and we are sure our readers
will find themselves moved for the better by this narrative of heroic
charity on the part of the nuns, and soldierly heroism on that of the men
to whom they ministered.&mdash;The Catholic World Magazine, New York.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span></p>

<h4>Record of Blameless Lives, “Strung Like Golden Beads on a
Silver Thread.”</h4>

<p>It is a sweet, and clean, and healthy book. The sketches are delightful
reading. The writer has poetic touch and a felicity of phrase.
Nothing is overdrawn. Mr. Barton writes without rhetoric, but with
wholesome sentiment, and rescues from the convents the story of the
part these Sisters took in the great drama of our Civil war. It has
been a labor of love, and the author has strung like golden beads on a
silver thread the record of the blameless lives of the Sisters and their
absolute devotion to duty. Literature and libraries are enriched by this
contribution to impartial history.&mdash;The Monongahela (Pa.) Daily Republican.</p>

<h4>“Magnificent Contribution to the Best Literature
of Our Day.”</h4>

<p>It was a beautiful thought to collect in one splendidly illustrated
volume the touching records of so many noble lives; to snatch from oblivion,
as it were, the names of those heroic Sisters whose deeds of mercy and
valor in our hospitals and on our battlefields have hitherto been known, in
some instances, to God and themselves alone. Your book is a unique and
magnificent contribution to the best literature of our day, and I wish
it the success it so richly deserves.&mdash;Eleanor C. Donnelly, of Philadelphia.</p>

<h4>“Supplies a Chapter Essential to the History
of the War.”</h4>

<p>It supplies a chapter essential to the history of our Civil War. The
Christian religion claims that its teachings have mitigated the horrors
of war; and the conduct of the Catholic Sisterhoods, North and South,
furnished a striking evidence of the truth of such claims, in the particular
instance of our domestic conflict.</p>

<p>It is such books as yours that accomplish the end which the Sovereign
Pontiff, Leo XIII, most ardently desires, in the relations of Church and
State&mdash;the perfect accord of the love of our faith with the love of country.&mdash;Rev.
Joseph V. O’Connor, of the diocese of Philadelphia.</p>

<h4>“The Whole Book Clean and Written in an Easy,
Practical Style.”</h4>

<p>I offer you my sincere congratulations for having given us a volume
that illustrates heroic charity, in a manner calculated to command the admiration
of all men. Men may differ about politics, economics, creed, the
relative merits of men of letters and affairs; they will be one, however, in
recognizing the “Angels of the Battlefield” as the grandest types of all
the Christian virtues&mdash;charity&mdash;the bond of the true brotherhood of man.</p>

<p>The whole book is so clean, and written in such an easy, practical
style that it is more fascinating than a classical novel&mdash;even than a well-written
sensational one. After reading it through one feels like reading
it to some friend, and calling his attention to its many beautiful passages
and the thrilling episodes in which it abounds. It is a volume that
all can read with ease and interest&mdash;not alone in clubs and homes, but
in the refectories and community-rooms of our convents. From cover to
cover it is, in every chapter, calculated to edify all and inspire thoughts
and aspirations that are good, sweet and elevating.&mdash;Rev. William
Walsh, of the diocese of Nashville, Tenn.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span></p>

<h4>“Embodies the Work of Several Years of Research and Correspondence.”</h4>

<p>This large volume embodies the work of several years of research
and correspondence on the part of the author. The war itself is the
merest thread upon which are strung these tales of womanly heroism
which have naught to do with political or sectional feeling. The brave
Sisters find in this volume their appreciative historian. The Catholic
Columbian “veterans should see that it finds a place in post libraries.”</p>

<p>The author has been at pains to collect all the data he could find&mdash;anecdotes,
thrilling incidents and statistics concerning the good nuns. His
book is very entertaining. We can well believe that it will delight many
an old soldier who knew the tender ministrations of the angels of the
battlefield. Veterans should see that it finds a place in the post libraries,
where such useful adjuncts are found.&mdash;Providence (R. I.) Visitor.</p>

<h4>“Will Take Its Place With Standard Histories of the
War.”</h4>

<p>This work is one of much more than usual interest. It will take its
place with the standard books concerning the history of the great Civil
War.&mdash;Camden (N. J.) Review.</p>

<h4>“Vivid Pictures of Sisters Who Have Gone to Their
Reward.”</h4>

<p>This interesting history gives especially vivid pictures of three Sisters
who became conspicuous by reason of their superior attainments&mdash;Sister
Anthony, Sister Gonzago and Sister Angela&mdash;all now gone to their reward.&mdash;Taggarts’
Times, Phila.</p>

<h4>The Data is “Presented in a Very Attractive
and Pleasing Form.”</h4>

<p>This interesting book is handsomely bound and beautifully and profusely
illustrated. It fills a gap in the history of the Rebellion. Mr.
Barton, who is a trained and able writer, has expended considerable time
in gathering the data about these noble women and he presents it in a
very attractive and pleasing form. The volume abounds with the personal
experience of the Sisters. The narrative is replete with thrilling and
pathetic incidents.&mdash;Pittsburg Dispatch.</p>

<h4>The Writer “Presents a Book With Not a Dull
Page in it.”</h4>

<p>The author of the book has succeeded in investing his work with an
absorbing interest. While he fully accomplishes his motive in setting
forth the numerous heroic acts and deeds of mercy of members of the
Sisterhoods, he has so interwoven them with stirring incidents of the
strife as to create a history that has an enduring value apart from its
personal interest. He has made his selections with a judgment of what
is most interesting and only acquired by a long experience in newspaper
work. He has, therefore, succeeded in making a book of over three
hundred pages with not a dull page in it. It is safe to say that no one
who reads the introductory chapter will willingly lay the book aside until
the whole work has been absorbed.&mdash;Major John W. Finney, in the
Pottsville Miners’ Journal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span></p>

<h4>“The Story of the Sisters Well Told in This
Charming Book.”</h4>

<p>Many books have been written about the faithful work of women during
the war, in hospitals and on the battlefields, but these books, at least
those we have seen of them, are strangely silent about the work of the
Catholic Sisterhoods in the same good cause. Some years ago we called
the attention of Mr. George Barton, of Philadelphia, to this fact and suggested
that a work of the Sisters in field and post hospitals during the
war would afford ample material for a most interesting and edifying
book. He saw the matter in the same light we did and set himself to the
task. The result is this admirable work. The labors of all the Sisters are
given in this charming book in detail and in chronological order.&mdash;Rev. L.
A. Lambert, LL. D., in New York Freeman’s Journal.</p>

<h4>“Illustrations in Perfect Taste from the Beginning
to the End.”</h4>

<p>Typographically the work is a masterpiece. The seventeen half-tone
illustrations are beautifully executed; besides they are in perfect taste
from the frontispiece, Thomas’ “Innocent Victim,” to the closing scene,
“Lincoln at Gettysburg.” The volume is bound in red, with green trimmings,
and the lettering is tastefully brought out in gilt, giving an
artistic effect of coloring, pleasing to the eye and in keeping with the
interior exquisiteness of finish. As a holiday book the publishers could
not have improved on the “Angels of the Battlefield.”&mdash;The Connecticut
Catholic.</p>

<h4>“It Should Appeal Especially to Veterans of
the War.”</h4>

<p>All sorts of books have been written about the late war, enough to
fill a good-sized library and, I think, I have read them all, but Mr. Barton’s
book is a new thing in that class of literature. The author has ventured
on untrodden paths, with the result that he has given to the public a vast
amount of interesting history that has not hitherto seen the light of day.
“Angels of the Battlefield” should meet with a generous welcome from all
classes and conditions of people, irrespective of locality or religious belief;
it should appeal especially to the veterans of the war, many of
whom now living have experienced the practical charity and kindness
of the gentle members of the various Sisterhoods. The general appearance
of the book is very attractive and makes it suitable for presentation
purposes.&mdash;Congressman James Rankin Young (S. M., in the Philadelphia
Evening Star).</p>

<h4>Fills “A Gap in the Chronicle of the Gruesome Years of the
War.”</h4>

<p>This work will fill, we believe, a gap in the chronicle of those gruesome
years. The unselfish deeds of other women have been often related,
but the incessant and universal help of the Catholic religious
of the battlefields has never yet been placed in an orderly fashion before
the world.&mdash;Catholic Standard and Times, Philadelphia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span></p>

<h4>The Effort “Was Well Worth Making, and the Task is Done
Admirably.”</h4>

<p>In the “Angels of the Battlefield” is given a history of the labors of
the Catholic Sisterhoods in the Civil War. Among all the agencies for
relief of suffering in that dreadful conflict, none was more beautiful and
more self-sacrificing than the work of these untiring Sisters. The effort
was well worth making, and Mr. Barton has done his task admirably.&mdash;Philadelphia
Evening Telegraph.</p>

<h4>The Reader “Brought Face to Face With the Sterner Realities
of War.”</h4>

<p>The author in this work leads us into an entirely new field of literature.
He treats of a subject never before taken up in such pretentious
shape. So vivid are his pictures of the great conflict and of the noble
and humane work done by these self-sacrificing “angels” that the reader
comes face to face with the sterner realities of the war. The book is an
altogether readable one, and is a worthy adjunct to the already published
literature of the Civil War.&mdash;Burlington (N. J.) Democrat.</p>

<h4>All Will “Welcome This Delightful Volume With Its Sprightly
Narrative.”</h4>

<p>Everyone who took part in the late war, on either side, will welcome
this delightful volume of reminiscence of one of the most beautiful and
touching aspects of that history so full of misfortune and horrors. The
special friends and admirers of the Sisterhoods, whose members participated,
will all seek to possess it, and also many Catholic apologists and
students of American history. The narrative is sprightly and abounds in
anecdotes. This publication well deserves the large sale it is sure to
have.&mdash;The (St. Louis) Church Progress.</p>

<h4>The “Clear, Crisp Newspaper English” One of Its Good
Points.”</h4>

<p>The fact that a writer has actually found a field or phase of our
national history unrecorded, or as newspaper men would say, uncovered,
by a book is sufficient to entitle this volume to mention by the newspapers.
The work has been well done, not only as to the amount and
systematic presentation of evidence, the authenticity of which is confirmed
by numerous authorities of unquestionable standing, both in and
out of the Catholic Church, but also in the manner of treatment, the
language being the clear, crisp newspaper English, without which no
book need be expected to meet with any great degree of popular success.&mdash;The
Camden (N. J.) Post.</p>

<h4>Illustrating “The Extent and the Superb Courage” of the
Sisters.</h4>

<p>To the story of the part which our American womanhood played in
the war for the Union Mr. Barton has contributed some new data in
the field of our war literature which hitherto has been untouched. Moved
by a spirit of gentle enthusiasm, Mr. Barton has painstakingly told in a book
of several hundred pages how the Sistershoods of the Roman Catholic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
Church toiled in the lowliest and most perilous offices of the nurse, as
they followed the armies into the very storm of shot and shell. The book
is full of anecdotes of historic value in illustrating the extent and superb
courage of the labors of these useful women. Let us hope that when
the true history of the Civil War shall be written, as it has yet to be,
there will be a place in it for them as among the noblest of their sex.&mdash;“Penn,”
in the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin.</p>

<h4>“A Comprehensive Book That Makes History, and
Valuable History.”</h4>

<p>Mr. Barton has written a book that makes history, and valuable history.
It is not one of the kind that, according to the proverb, his
enemies (if he has any) need rejoice over, but a tribute to the noble
band to which every kindly heart, irrespective of religious faith, will
respond. The author gives us a compact presentation of the history of
these noble women in the matricidal strike of the 60’s, a subject which
has been hitherto sadly neglected. The humility of the Sisters made the
collection of data difficult, but stories included in the work have been
gathered after much painstaking effort.&mdash;Louis N. Megargee in the Philadelphia
Times.</p>

<h4>“The Twenty-Seven Chapters of the Volume Crowded
With Stories.”</h4>

<p>The twenty-seven chapters of the volume are crowded with incidents
and stories, some pathetic, some humorous, and others still historical.
There are fleeting glimpses of Generals McClellan, Butler, Jefferson Davis
and other characters of the time. One chapter is devoted to a collection
of non-Catholic tributes to the Sisters. There is a letter in the volume
that reveals General Butler in a chivalrous light. Some of the Sisters of
a convent at New Orleans had complained that their property was being
damaged by the military operations in that vicinity, and in response the
General sent a reply couched in language that presents the man in a new
light to those not intimately acquainted with him.&mdash;Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>

<h4>“A Fascinating Volume that Perpetuates the Memories
of the Sisterhoods in the Civil War.”</h4>

<p>To the annals of the war George Barton, an historical student of Philadelphia,
has just added a fascinating volume entitled “Angels of the
Battlefield,” in which he has endeavored to perpetuate the memories of
the members of the Roman Catholic Sisterhoods who helped to care for
the sick, wounded and dying in the Civil War. It is hard to obtain information
from such people, and as military records are proverbially careless
in such matters, the Sisters not coming within military jurisdiction,
the author was compelled to obtain his material by the slow process of
personal application to the witnesses of the many affairs in which these
Christian workers were the chief actors. The Sisters received no pay, and
the only gifts they accepted were upon the condition that the gift would
in turn be given again, in order to do good among those who most needed
it. Their services will never be forgotten, and the story of their devotion
and sacrifices will ever be one of the prettiest chapters in the annals
of the Union.&mdash;Margherita Arline Hamm in the New York Mail and Express.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span></p>

<h4>“A Book Valuable as a Record and in its
Literary Style.”</h4>

<p>Mr. Barton has presented to the public a valuable book, valuable as a
record and valuable in its literary style. It is well described by a historical
critic as a tribute to the noble band of women samaritans to which
every kindly heart, irrespective of religious faith, will respond. The Sisters
of Charity of Nazareth, who so readily and with such self-sacrificing
heroism volunteered their humble services to help the sick and administer
to the dying in the great Civil conflict receive in “Angels of the
Battlefield” a just and due recognition of their moral courage and heroism.&mdash;The
Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times.</p>

<h4>“The Descriptions of the More Important Engagements
are Really Graphic.”</h4>

<p>His facts, gathered from letters still extant, from conversations had
with many of the surviving nuns, and the testimony of not a few who owed
their lives from the ministrations of the Sisters, give a very complete
and accurate account of his subject. He traces the work of the Sisters
at times with a vividness that is startling. His descriptions of the more
important engagements, especially of Shiloh, Antietam and Gettysburg,
are really graphic, and they give us the truest idea of the noble character
of the Sisters, who amid such scenes of carnage pursued uninterruptedly
their mission of love and mercy. “The Angels of the Battlefield” should
be read by everyone who desires to possess a complete knowledge of the
war.&mdash;The New World, Chicago.</p>

<h4>“It is Well to Let the World Know of Their Heroic
Services.”</h4>

<p>Although the noble Sisters who for the love of God went forth during
the Civil War to nurse the sick and wounded do not desire to have their
deeds perpetuated on earth, it is well to let the world know of the heroic
services they rendered from 1861-5. The author presents in a compact
form the history of the labors of the Sisters during this period in a most
readable manner. The volume contains handsome illustrations of some of
the more prominent generals and Sisters of the war. Several valuable
pictures of battles are also given.&mdash;The Church News, Washington.</p>

<h4>“Praiseworthy Attempt to Give Plain Facts Without
Comment.”</h4>

<p>The “News” compliments the author upon the excellence of his work
and commends it to its readers. The labor of four of the most conspicuous
Sisterhoods are detailed in a most complete and thorough manner.
The book begins with the work of the Sisters of Charity, and then takes
up in natural sequence the labors of the Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of
St. Joseph’s and the Sisters of the Holy Cross. There has been a praiseworthy
and successful attempt to give plain facts without comment or
unnecessary coloring. It is one of the best books of the year.&mdash;The Harrisburg
News.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<h4>“Fleeting Glimpses of Many of the Great Characters
of the Time.”</h4>

<p>The twenty-seven chapters of the volume are crowded with incidents
and stories, some pathetic, some humorous and others still, historical.
There are flitting glimpses of General McClellan, General Butler, Jefferson
Davis, and other characters of the time. One chapter is devoted to a
collection of non-Catholic tributes to the Sisters; while an appendix furnishes
the reader with some interesting and important facts that it was
deemed advisable to separate from the text.&mdash;The Union and Times, Buffalo.</p>

<h4>Right Rev. I. F. Horstmann, D. D., Bishop of
Cleveland.</h4>

<p>It was a happy thought for you, even at this late hour, to gather
together some of the glorious records of the labors of the noble bands
of Sisters on the field and in the hospitals during the war. Gather up
the fragments lest they be lost. These victories of charity ought to be at
least as memorable as the bloody triumphs of the battlefield.&mdash;Ign. F.
Horstmann, Bishop of Cleveland.</p>

<h4>Translation.</h4>

<p>“Angels of the Battlefield.” A history of the labors of the Catholic
Sisterhoods in the Civil War, by George Barton, author. The Catholic Art
Publishing Company, Burd Building, 9th and Chestnut sts., Philadelphia.
The work is illustrated with the finest engravings and printed on very
fine paper. It relates to the work of the various Sisterhoods in caring
for the wounded soldiers in the late American Civil War. A history of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
healing wounds and cleansing the bloodstains therefrom is certainly more
noble than that of the infliction and the shedding of blood. The reading
is not less worthy, especially if one does not wish to judge our race by
its barbarity, but by its virtue. It has been very gratifying to us, and perhaps
will be so to others who endeavor to humanize mankind.”&mdash;Arcade
Mogyorossy, Editor Praeco Latinus Menstruum-Gentium-Latinum.</p>

<h4>Pleasure Taken “in Complimenting the Author
on His Splendid Production.”</h4>

<p>We are personally acquainted with the author, have read the book
carefully, and take great pleasure in complimenting Mr. Barton on his
splendid production. While the battle scenes, camp life and other stirring
events of the war period from 1861-5 have received attention from the
bright minds, and the facts recorded on the pages of history in every
civilized country, yet this book by Mr. Barton is the first that treats
exclusively on the great work accomplished by the Catholic Sisterhoods
in the Civil war.&mdash;Clearfield Republican.</p>

<h4>“Recounts Many Incidents Which Will Be Read
With the Deepest Interest.”</h4>

<p>“Angels of the Battlefield” is a well printed, generously illustrated
volume of more than 300 pages, containing no inconsiderable amount of
information about the services rendered by Sisters of different religious
orders during the Civil war. Mr. Barton writes feelingly of their devotedness
and self sacrifices, and recounts many incidents which will be
read with the deepest interest. The author has wisely touched upon the
leading events of the years 1861-5, and thus rendered the volume more
acceptable to general readers than it would otherwise be. He is to be
congratulated on the services he has rendered to the cause of religion
and truth.&mdash;The Ave Maria.</p>

<h4>“This Comprehensive History of Mercy Reads Almost Like
a Romance.”</h4>

<p>“Angels of the Battlefield” is an elegantly bound volume, in cloth,
with gilt back and front, and beautifully illustrated. The book is
crowded with incidents and stories, pathetic, humorous and historical,
and the story of the self-sacrificing work of the Sisters is told in a compact
and comprehensive form. This history of mercy reads almost like a
romance.&mdash;Boston Daily Globe.</p>

<h4>“Tribute of Permanent Preservation Well Carried Out and
Richly Deserved.”</h4>

<p>It is a noble record, North, South or West, and the tribute of permanent
preservation so well carried out by Mr. Barton is richly deserved.
We cannot afford to let the noble deeds of our women in the Civil
war, any more than those of our men, die out from our recollection and
gratitude. The Catholic Sisterhoods were active in the work of helping
and nursing in the Civil war, as they are in all wars and epidemics. Their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
work was so unobtrusive that there has been difficulty in getting the
data necessary for this record, but by means of personal interviews and
the examination of records and newspaper files the author does justice to
the devotion of these good Sisters.&mdash;The Baltimore Sun.</p>

<h4>“The Nobler Literature of the World Gains
By This Work.”</h4>

<p>One of the most beautiful stories of the Civil War has been fittingly
told at the end of thirty-two years. The materials were not easily gathered,
for, as the author remarks, a genuine humility has stood in the way
of the collection of the data, but the work has been done, and the nobler
literature of the world gains by its performance. As the self-sacrificing
Sisters ministered to all whom they could reach during the war, never asking
whether the uniform was blue or gray, so a striking and appropriate
characteristic of this book is the fact that the narrative is interwoven
without regard to the opposing lines of armies.&mdash;St. Louis Globe-Democrat.</p>

<h4>Author of the Work has Succeeded in Compiling
“a Fascinating Volume.”</h4>

<p>The book fills 300 pages with its accounts of the different Sisterhoods
and their leading members. Incidentally it brings in many of the great
men of the sixties, such as Archbishop Hughes, whose labors for the
Union have made him immortal; Archbishop Kenrich, Archbishop Ryan,
General McClellan, General Butler, Abraham Lincoln, Archbishop Elder,
General Grant, Archbishop Spaulding, General Anderson, General Wood,
General Rosecrans, Governor Morton and Col. Mulligan. The author in
his endeavor to perpetuate the memories of the modest members of the
Catholic Sisterhoods, who helped the sick and wounded in the Civil War,
has compiled a fascinating volume.&mdash;Irish-American, New York.</p>

<h4>“Performed His Task With Excellent Judgment and in a
Broad Spirit.”</h4>

<p>The author of this book has performed his task with excellent judgment
and in a broad spirit. Most of the stories given were gathered in
personal interviews, by examination of various archives and records, and
by an extensive correspondence with Government officials, army veterans
and Superioresses of Convents and communities. The gentle ways, the
fathomless sympathies of the Sisters soothed and cheered the soldier who
lay sick and wounded. The Sister seemed to the sufferer like a link to his
mother. He was far more ready to unbosom his thoughts to the Sister
than to the doctor. In his last moments he would give the Sister his
messages, and asked to hold her hand as his life drifted away.&mdash;The Western
Chronicle.</p>

Dr. John Shaw Billings was born in Switzerland County,
Ind., April 12, 1839. He received his degree in medicine in 1860,
and the following year was appointed demonstrator of anatomy in
the Medical College of Ohio. The same year he was appointed an
assistant surgeon in the United States army, in which position he continued
until placed in charge of the hospital at Washington, in 1863.
He was later appointed medical inspector of the Army of the Potomac.
In 1894 he was appointed surgeon general, and placed in
charge of the division of vital statistics. In addition to this he has
been medical advisor to trustees of the Johns Hopkins University.</p></div>

Rev. Louis Hippolyte Gache, S. J., was born June 18, 1817,
in the department of Ardeche, France. His early studies were pursued
at the College of Bourg, St. Andeole. At the outbreak of the
Civil War he was appointed chaplain of a Louisiana regiment in
the Confederate army. Owing to losses in battle, sickness, etc., the
regiment ceased to exist in two years, and Father Gache from then to
the close of the war was attached as chaplain to military hospitals.
At the end of the conflict he returned to Grand Coteau, remaining
there a year. He was then transferred to the new province of
Maryland, now that of New York-Baltimore, becoming a professor
in Loyola College. He has occupied various posts of responsibility
since that time, and only last year (1896) celebrated his golden
jubilee or fiftieth year in the Society of Jesus, at the Church of
the Gesu, in Philadelphia.</p></div>

One of the nurses who did splendid service in the South was
Sister Mary Gabriel. She was the daughter of the late Henry W.
and Barbara Kraft, of Philadelphia. When little more than a child
she entered the novitiate at Emmittsburg, Md., an action which
even then had been delayed a year in deference to her father’s expressed
wish. At the end of two years she was professed on the
Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, 1842.</p>

<p>Her first mission was the Charity Hospital, New Orleans,
where she entered upon what proved to be a long life of devotion to
the poor sick. Soon after her arrival she contracted the dreaded
yellow fever while nursing stricken patients, and her life was despaired
of. She recovered, however, and was again at the post of
danger in the plague-stricken city. During the war she labored among
the dying soldiers at Mobile and Holly Springs. Twice in later
years she visited Philadelphia, the second visit following retirement
from active duty. It was during this second visit and while she was
staying at St. Joseph’s Hospital that she celebrated her golden
jubilee. Her superiors finding her so full of vigor and zeal, again
assigned her to active duty, and at her own request she was returned
to the Charity Hospital, New Orleans. This devoted Sister
passed to her reward about the fall of 1896.</p></div>

The fiftieth anniversary of the foundation in Philadelphia of
the Sisters of St. Joseph was celebrated May 5, 1897, at the Mount
St. Joseph’s Novitiate, in Chestnut Hill. About ninety priests from
Philadelphia and adjacent dioceses were present, and the venerable
Monsignor Cantwell, who, with Bishop O’Hara, of Scranton, was
the only one then living who extended the hand of welcome to the
three Sisters who came from St. Louis fifty years previous, was
among the guests. There were present also about two hundred visiting
Sisters from the various Catholic institutions in the city and
several from Rochester, N. Y., and Flushing. L. I. Archbishop
Ryan made a brief address of congratulation to the pupils and the
community. He said that forty-five years ago he knew the Sisters of
the St. Louis Community, and that he had watched their astounding
growth with much interest. He paid a glowing tribute to the beneficence
and charity of the community, and prayed that God
would cause them to prosper in the future as He had done in the
past.</p></div>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
